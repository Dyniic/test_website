Vive Per√∫ is a nonprofit organization dedicated to fostering understanding of Peruvian culture and providing aid to Peruvian communities. For the PanAmerican Rally, Vive Peru bravely accepted the responsibility to receive and integrate the Last Responders ambulance into the Trujillo medical network. Reaching Trujillo, the team discovered an organization committed to making an impact in struggling neighborhoods, orphanages, and hospitals.
