description: The Pan American Rally was a Team Last Responders 'first'. For this project, the team designed a route, time table and established relationships with charities without the assistance of an organizer. The project revolved around raising money, donating medical supplies, and two vehicles to our partner charities - Vive Peru and Esperanca.
