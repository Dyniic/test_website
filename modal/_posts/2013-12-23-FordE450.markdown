Trans-Am Emergency Medical Services posted a Ford E450 Ambulance on craigslist for 5000 dollars. At the time of purchase, the vehicle was still in service which gave the team extra confidence that the vehicle was in good shape. After a clean bill of health from 54th Street Auto Center and a Team Last Responders paint job, the ambulance was adventure ready. All that confidence was misplaced, and a trouble-free drive was not to be. 1500 miles in, the ambulance experienced a major breakdown in Minden, Lousisiana requiring a replacement axle. 5200 miles in, the left rear suspension bolt snapped. 6000 miles in, the rear axle began leaking lubricant. None of these problems stopped the ambulance from crossing the finish line in Tujillo, Peru.
