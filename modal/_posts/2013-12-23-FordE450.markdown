Team Last Responders purchased the PanAmerican Rally ambulance directly from Trans-Am Emergency Medical Services. The team felt pretty confident about the vehicle's condition, as Trans-Am EMS assured the team that it was still in service at the time of purchase. After a clean bill of health from 54th Street Auto Center and a Team Last Responders paint job, the ambulance was adventure ready. 

A trouble-free drive was not meant to be. 1500 miles in, the ambulance's rear axle seized up. 5200 miles in, the left rear suspension bolt snapped. 6000 miles in, a seal in the rear axle wore out. But none of these problems had a chance at stopping Team Last Responders from crossing the finish line.
