description: Founded in 2007, Mali Health Organizing Project is non profit organization that focuses on organizing child and maternal health projects to transform communities at the grass roots level. MHOP operates in Sikoro, a slum in the outskirts of Bamako. For the 2012 Timbuktu Challenge, Team Last Responders allied with MHOP to learn about the problems and challenges that people face in Mali. Through partnership and collaboration, Team Last Responders raised money and donations to help MHOP's ongoing projects.
