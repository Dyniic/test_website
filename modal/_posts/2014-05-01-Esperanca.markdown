Clean water. Safe housing. Nutritious food. Esperança envisions a world in which the foundations of health and well being are available to people everywhere. For more than four decades it has joined with communities worldwide, providing tools, training, and support necessary to help them reach that goal. Team Last Responders partnered with Esperança in 2013 for the PanAmerican Rally. On the journey, the team visited their offices in Phoenix, Nicaragua, and Bolivia, learning about the many challenges that these developing communities face.
