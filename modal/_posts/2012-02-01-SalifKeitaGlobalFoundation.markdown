description: The Salif Keita Foundation was founded by Salif Keita, a Malian singer who focuses on addressing the plight of albinos in Africa. For the 2012 Timbuktu Challenge, Team MMT partnered with this organization to determine how best to organize an ambulance donation. At the conclusion of the 2012 Timbuktu Challenge, the vehicle was successfully donated to a Hospital in Bamako, Mali. There the vehicle would be used as a mobile health clinic to serve the entire region.
