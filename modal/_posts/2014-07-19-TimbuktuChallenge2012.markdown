The Timbuktu Challenge is a 4,000 miles car rally that starts in London and ends near Timbuktu, Mali. For this event, teams acquire cars for donation, gather in London and drive to Western Africa in 3 weeks. Team Last Responders answered the call to adventure with an Made-in-USA Wheeled Coach Ambulance and went the extra mile of shipping the car to Liverpool from New York.
