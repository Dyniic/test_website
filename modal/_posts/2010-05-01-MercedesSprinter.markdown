The hunt for a Mongol Rally ambulance was supposed to end with Stephen's trip to Germany. As adventures tend unfold in unpredictable ways, the mission to complete the purchase didn't pan out. Instead, Stephen recruited a new teammate, Lillie, who saved the day by finding an ambulance for the team. 10,000 miles later, the ambulance crossed the finish line, and resumed its life as an emergency vehicle, out in the Mongolian grasslands.
