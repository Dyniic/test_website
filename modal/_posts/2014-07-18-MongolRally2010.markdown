The Mongol Rally is the ultimate endurance rally that covers the insane distance of 10,000 miles from London UK to Ulan Bator, Mongolia. In the summer of 2010, Team Last Responders joined teams from around the world to attempt this challenge. For this first  charity rally, the team raised money and donated an ambulance benefiting MSF, Mercycorp, and the country of Mongolia.
