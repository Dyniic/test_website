Team Last Responders found the Timbuktu Challenge ambulance on Ebay. This diesel powered beauty served the community of Spencer, Massachusetts for many years before it retired to a used car lot. In the weeks following the purchase, the team turned to Ivy Lane Auto for a mechanical checkup, paint job, and disco ball installation.

Despite all the careful preparation, the ambulance suffered a break down between Casablanca and Marrakech...and again in Western Sahara. Resuming the journey tested the team's patience, resolve, and resourcefulness. But in the end, the ambulance returned to the road and triumphantly crossed the finish line only 6 weeks late.
