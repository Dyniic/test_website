Many things can be found on Ebay - including a Timbuktu Challenge Ambulance. This diesel powered beauty served the community of Spencer Massachusetts for many years before landing on a used car lot in Agawam, Massachusetts. All it took was a test drive to convince the team that this was the one the team would take to Africa. The only things missing some repair work, a new paint job, and disco ball. Once the vehicle was prepped, the team shipped the car to Liverpool and the journey began. Despite all the work put into preparation, the car suffered a brake down between Casablanca and Marrakech. Getting the ambulance back on the road tested the team's patience, resolve, and resourcefulness. In the end, the ambulance return to the road and triumphantly crossed the finish line - a month late.
