I was fortunate to have Heather Anderson as my coach during my transition into retirement.  I was excited about the seemingly endless opportunities that retirement presented, and needed support in deciding just where I wanted to focus and spend my energy and time.  Heather created the perfect coaching program for me, with metaphors and practices that  stretched and inspired me.  Heather was attentive to my progress, and continually encouraged and challenged me, ensuring I was on track. Heather is a dedicated and insightful coach and working with her was a great experience.  

Thank you Heather for your commitment to my development and for offering me a perspective and practices that have enabled me to move forward with focus and clarity.  Based on my experience, I am confident that your future clients will be well-served by you.
