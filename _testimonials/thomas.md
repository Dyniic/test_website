In spring 2016, having recovered from a major illness, I felt like a novice surfer at the mercy of a vast ocean, a prisoner of my fate. At this junction of my life, I was very fortunate to came across my coach Heather, who helped me to discover the root cause of my challenge. Heather is a true professional who is highly knowledgeable, compassionate, empathetic and yet always remains objective and analytical. She will methodologically work through your problems by peeling away layers of half-truths and misconceptions to reach the core, which, in my case, turned out to be something that I was not aware of at the conscious level.

Heather came to each session very well prepared, and the instructions that she gave me for homework and exercises were clearly laid out. After each session, I would be left with new awareness about myself to contemplate. The coaching exercises that she taught me were simple and fun but highly effective. Doing them diligently, I gradually felt the changes coming from within, which in turn allowed me to grow and to better reach my goals.

I have consulted quite a number of other helping professionals before and I can attest that Heather is among the best. I have benefited tremendously from Heatherâ€™s coaching sessions and would highly recommend her to anybody who is looking for an intelligent and knowledgeable coach to help them reach their goals.
