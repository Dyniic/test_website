I was very fortunate to came across my coach Heather, who helped me to discover the root cause of my challenge.  Heather came to each session very well prepared, and after each session, I left with new awareness about myself to contemplate. The coaching exercises that she taught me were simple and fun but highly effective. Doing them diligently, I gradually felt the changes coming from within, which in turn allowed me to grow and to better reach my goals.  I have consulted quite a number of other helping professionals before and I can attest that Heather is among the best. I have benefited tremendously from Heatherâ€™s coaching sessions and would highly recommend her to anybody who is looking for an intelligent and knowledgeable coach to help them reach their goals.
