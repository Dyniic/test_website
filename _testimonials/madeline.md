I had the pleasure of being coached by Heather for several months in 2013.  During that time, I found Heather to be professional in her approach and her high degree of preparation for each session. Perhaps more importantly, Heather and her coaching practices are compassionate and effective. She listens with a keen ear and carves out the heart of the matter quickly, and then helps her clients to navigate solutions.
