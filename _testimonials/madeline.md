I had the pleasure of being coached by Heather for several months in 2013.  During that time, I found Heather to be professional in her approach and her high degree of preparation for each session. Perhaps more importantly, Heather and her coaching practices are compassionate and effective. She listens with a keen ear and carves out the heart of the matter quickly, and then helps her clients to navigate solutions.
At the time, I was feeling that my spending habits had a mind of their own, and was frustrated that I felt I couldnâ€™t save money, but at the same time had nothing to show for my spending.  Heather helped me to identify, and then to work to understand my thought processes and resulting behaviour that led to over-spending. She led me down a path that helped me to feel empowered over my own decision-making choices. Rather than suggest the standard cookie cutter advice on tracking spending or implementing automatic savings, Heather helped me to reframe my position. In doing this, she used terms, analogies, and metaphors that spoke to my interests and my personality.  By helping me learn to reframe my position, and through easy (sometimes fun) practical exercises, Heather helped me to understand how to take control of my issue and begin to change my thoughts and thus, my behaviour. Since working with Heather, I have continued to use the approaches she helped me to navigate, and even managed to save up a down payment for my first house.
