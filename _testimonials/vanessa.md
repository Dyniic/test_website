During 2013, I was at a crossroads.  To progress in my career, I needed to transition from being an economist to a policy analyst.  This was a daunting prospect for me.  I turned to Heather for career coaching and advice.  I felt perfectly comfortable with her.  She provided a safe space to discuss my concerns and a gentle push in the right direction.  Over time, my skills started to improve and with it, my confidence.  I canâ€™t thank Heather enough for believing in me.
