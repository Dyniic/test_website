Heather helped me at a time in life when I felt completely "stuck". Under her guidance and through the use of effective tools and practices I was able to overcome the fear, inertia and confusion that had me so blocked. I now use these tools everyday for a continued sense of well being and to move forward towards the fulfilment & success I desire in life.
Heather is a truly caring, dedicated and discerning coach. I would recommend her to anyone.
