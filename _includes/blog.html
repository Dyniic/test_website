                                It’s no secret that the environment is in danger. Prevent further degradation by switching to a more sustainable lifestyle. Small changes, although seemingly negligible, can contribute to great change over sustained periods of time. We only have one earth; we should do our best to return it to an abundant, vibrant state as soon as possible. And that begins with us. 
                            </p> 
              
                                <h3>Purposeful Shopping</h3>
                            <p>
                                The old saying “reduce, reuse, recycle” still holds true today. Every product has an “environmental footprint,” which includes the materials needed to create it to the pollution emitted during the manufacturing process to the packaging that is eventually relocated to landfills. Before buying something, ask yourself, “Do I really need this?”. Ensuring each purchase is necessary will both save money and reduce environmental footprint. 
                            </p>
                                <h3> Make sure big purchases have big environmental benefits</h3>
                            <p>    
                                When car shopping, consider fuel-efficient models - not only will you save thousands in gas money, but you will also drastically reduce your carbon footprint over the years. If you’re looking to buy a refrigerator, washer, dryer, or microwave, be aware of Energy Star labels to help you find the most efficient, energy saving appliances. For new water heaters, upgrade to solar.
                            </p>     
                                <h3> Go plastic free - #standagainstplastic</h3>
                            <p>    
                                With a 1000 year decomposition time, plastic never really just 'goes away.' Today, it accounts for just over 40% of the world's ocean surface. Numerous marine mammals are killed after ingesting or being impaled by plastic. Implementing plastic-free habits in your daily life, such as using reusable shopping bags, water bottles, and straws, and supporting brands that are sustainable, can help to reduce plastic pollution.
                            </p>   
                                <h3> Pay attention to labels</h3>
                            <p>     
                                Similar to #3, buying goods that are Fair Trade, organic, or "shade-grown" can contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle. "Shade-grown" coffee is grown while keeping forest habitats intact for migratory birds and other species. Fair Trade certified goods support companies dedicated to sustainable production and fair wages. Organic foods help to keep harmful pesticides out, protecting workers, wildlife, and the environment. 
                            </p>     
                                <h3> Mindful Eating</h3>
                            <p>   
                                 Meat production is undoubtedly one of the most environmentally destructive industries on the planet. It is also a major contributor to pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and habitat destruction. Each day, we can contribute to a reduced environmental footprint - and each time we eat, we can choose to improve the health of the planet by reducing our meat intake. In addition, around 40% of edible food in the US is wasted. Smart, planned shopping and a well devised meal plan can ensure complete use of the foods you purchase.

                            <h3> Tovah Negus</h3><br>
                            <time datetime="7-28-2019">JULY 28, 2019</time>

                                Interest in environmental conservation has grown rapidly. People have been attempting to find more sustainable plastic alternatives, from avocado seed straws to metals straws and reusable bottles. This surgance has been astronomically helpful in raising awareness; however, there are still many people who refuse to change their destructive ways. They are insistent on the fact that climate change is not real and that our plastic consumption doesn’t matter in the long run.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are many arguments used by climate change deniers. According to Business Insider, approximately 33% of deniers say that the weather has not changed around them, 18% say that the temperature varies naturally, another 12% state that there is conflicting or insufficient scientific evidence, and 5% of deniers state that the news reports and research are false. These deniers have a great amount of influence in the business sector, where the majority of the plastics pollutants come from. What is needed is proof that sustainability is more efficient and more profitable. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                According to Business Queensland, there are many ways that an environmentally conscientious business is profitable. There are three main points: <br>
                                   <b>Recycling reduces costs                  </b><br>   If one were to use reusable products, there would be reduced materials expenses, since making or buying things like plastic utensils and straws would not be necessary.
                                   <b>Green practices can attract new customers</b><br>   Businesses that are known to be environmentally conscientious are more likely to attract customers, in general, than non-environmentally friendly businesses. <br>
                                   <b>Improves Sustainability                  </b><br>   If a business is less reliant on resources like plastic, they will beat out their competitors when prices rise due to climate change. Furthermore, they are more likely to comply with future legislation.

                                 It’s no secret that climate change is one of the world’s most pressing issues. With an estimated 11 years left before irreversible climate change and the continued lack of global awareness, the outlook is bleak. Many blame the current scale of the climate crisis on the lack of political action; however, legislation tends to follow public opinion, as politicians often back trends that garner the most support. This means that educated individuals who guide others can in turn influence the politicians responsible for such legislation in the first place. Sounds great, right? Here are some books to get you started.
