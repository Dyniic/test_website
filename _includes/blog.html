                                It’s no secret that the environment is in danger. Prevent further degradation by switching to a more sustainable lifestyle. Small changes, although seemingly negligible, can contribute to great change over sustained periods of time. We only have one earth; we should do our best to return it to an abundant, vibrant state as soon as possible. And that begins with us.

                                <h3>Purposeful Shopping</h3>
                            <p>
                                The old saying “reduce, reuse, recycle” still holds true today. Every product has an “environmental footprint,” which includes the materials needed to create it to the pollution emitted during the manufacturing process to the packaging that is eventually relocated to landfills. Before buying something, ask yourself, “Do I really need this?”. Ensuring each purchase is necessary will both save money and reduce environmental footprint. 
                            </p>
                                <h3> Make sure big purchases have big environmental benefits</h3>
                            <p>    
                                When car shopping, consider fuel-efficient models - not only will you save thousands in gas money, but you will also drastically reduce your carbon footprint over the years. If you’re looking to buy a refrigerator, washer, dryer, or microwave, be aware of Energy Star labels to help you find the most efficient, energy saving appliances. For new water heaters, upgrade to solar.

                                <h3> Go plastic free - #standagainstplastic</h3>
                            <p>    
                                With a 1000 year decomposition time, plastic never really just 'goes away.' Today, it accounts for just over 40% of the world's ocean surface. Numerous marine mammals are killed after ingesting or being impaled by plastic. Implementing plastic-free habits in your daily life, such as using reusable shopping bags, water bottles, and straws, and supporting brands that are sustainable, can help to reduce plastic pollution.

                                <h3> Pay attention to labels</h3>
                            <p>     
                                Similar to #3, buying goods that are Fair Trade, organic, or "shade-grown" can contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle. "Shade-grown" coffee is grown while keeping forest habitats intact for migratory birds and other species. Fair Trade certified goods support companies dedicated to sustainable production and fair wages. Organic foods help to keep harmful pesticides out, protecting workers, wildlife, and the environment.

                                <h3> Mindful Eating</h3>
                            <p>   
                                 Meat production is undoubtedly one of the most environmentally destructive industries on the planet. It is also a major contributor to pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and habitat destruction. Each day, we can contribute to a reduced environmental footprint - and each time we eat, we can choose to improve the health of the planet by reducing our meat intake. In addition, around 40% of edible food in the US is wasted. Smart, planned shopping and a well devised meal plan can ensure complete use of the foods you purchase.
