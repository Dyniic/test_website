                            <h3> Bailey Hirota</h3><br>

                                It’s no secret that the environment is in danger. Prevent further degradation by switching to a more sustainable lifestyle. Small changes, although seemingly negligible, can contribute to great change over sustained periods of time. We only have one earth; we should do our best to return it to an abundant, vibrant state as soon as possible. And that begins with us. 
                            </p> 
              
                                <h3>Purposeful Shopping</h3>
                            <p>
                                The old saying “reduce, reuse, recycle” still holds true today. Every product has an “environmental footprint,” which includes the materials needed to create it to the pollution emitted during the manufacturing process to the packaging that is eventually relocated to landfills. Before buying something, ask yourself, “Do I really need this?”. Ensuring each purchase is necessary will both save money and reduce environmental footprint. 
                            </p>
                                <h3> Make sure big purchases have big environmental benefits</h3>
                            <p>    
                                When car shopping, consider fuel-efficient models - not only will you save thousands in gas money, but you will also drastically reduce your carbon footprint over the years. If you’re looking to buy a refrigerator, washer, dryer, or microwave, be aware of Energy Star labels to help you find the most efficient, energy saving appliances. For new water heaters, upgrade to solar.
                            </p>     
                                <h3> Go plastic free - #standagainstplastic</h3>
                            <p>    
                                With a 1000 year decomposition time, plastic never really just 'goes away.' Today, it accounts for just over 40% of the world's ocean surface. Numerous marine mammals are killed after ingesting or being impaled by plastic. Implementing plastic-free habits in your daily life, such as using reusable shopping bags, water bottles, and straws, and supporting brands that are sustainable, can help to reduce plastic pollution.
                            </p>   
                                <h3> Pay attention to labels</h3>
                            <p>     
                                Similar to #3, buying goods that are Fair Trade, organic, or "shade-grown" can contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle. "Shade-grown" coffee is grown while keeping forest habitats intact for migratory birds and other species. Fair Trade certified goods support companies dedicated to sustainable production and fair wages. Organic foods help to keep harmful pesticides out, protecting workers, wildlife, and the environment. 
                            </p>     
                                <h3> Mindful Eating</h3>
                            <p>   
                                 Meat production is undoubtedly one of the most environmentally destructive industries on the planet. It is also a major contributor to pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and habitat destruction. Each day, we can contribute to a reduced environmental footprint - and each time we eat, we can choose to improve the health of the planet by reducing our meat intake. In addition, around 40% of edible food in the US is wasted. Smart, planned shopping and a well devised meal plan can ensure complete use of the foods you purchase.

                                Interest in environmental conservation has grown rapidly. People have been attempting to find more sustainable plastic alternatives, from avocado seed straws to metals straws and reusable bottles. This surgance has been astronomically helpful in raising awareness; however, there are still many people who refuse to change their destructive ways. They are insistent on the fact that climate change is not real and that our plastic consumption doesn’t matter in the long run.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are many arguments used by climate change deniers. According to Business Insider, approximately 33% of deniers say that the weather has not changed around them, 18% say that the temperature varies naturally, another 12% state that there is conflicting or insufficient scientific evidence, and 5% of deniers state that the news reports and research are false. These deniers have a great amount of influence in the business sector, where the majority of the plastics pollutants come from. What is needed is proof that sustainability is more efficient and more profitable. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                According to Business Queensland, there are many ways that an environmentally conscientious business is profitable. There are three main points: <br>
                                   <b>Recycling reduces costs                  </b><br>   If one were to use reusable products, there would be reduced materials expenses, since making or buying things like plastic utensils and straws would not be necessary.
                                   <b>Green practices can attract new customers</b><br>   Businesses that are known to be environmentally conscientious are more likely to attract customers, in general, than non-environmentally friendly businesses. <br>
                                   <b>Improves Sustainability                  </b><br>   If a business is less reliant on resources like plastic, they will beat out their competitors when prices rise due to climate change. Furthermore, they are more likely to comply with future legislation.

                             <h2><b> 5 Interesting Books on the Climate Crisis Everyone Should Read</h2></b><br>
                             <h3> Tovah Negus</h3><br>
                             <time datetime="7-31-2019">JULY 31, 2019</time><br>
                             <p>
                                 It’s no secret that climate change is one of the world’s most pressing issues. With an estimated 11 years left before irreversible climate change and the continued lack of global awareness, the outlook is bleak. Many blame the current scale of the climate crisis on the lack of political action; however, legislation tends to follow public opinion, as politicians often back trends that garner the most support. This means that educated individuals who guide others can in turn influence the politicians responsible for such legislation in the first place. Sounds great, right? Here are some books to get you started.

                            <h3> Kaitlyn Duffy</h3><br>
                            <time datetime="7-31-2019">JULY 31, 2019</time>
                            <p>
                                Thirty-three public schools in Howard County were recognized for mold outbreaks in locker rooms, gyms, and athletic storage closets. This wasn’t a first - in 2016, there were exactly twelve Howard County schools that had higher level molds than what was expected. Now, the complaints from students and faculty have rolled in once again.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The main sources of the outbreaks are athletic departments, like locker rooms, and sports gear, such as helmets, volleyballs, and swim caps. Some schools involved are Ellicott Mills Middle School, Lime Kiln Middle School, River Hill High School, Hammond Elementary, and Northfield Elementary. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Mold growing is a definite health hazard. The effects of mold include asthma, allergic reactions, and irritation in the eyes, nose, throat, lungs, and skin. Health guideline officials have taken notice and have investigated janitors and staff members that may be held responsible for involvement in the outbreak. For containment, strict procedures have been established. First, IEQ officials review each school by doing walk-throughs. Then, the Office of Environment contacts each official who submits a concern, and lastly, a school hygienist drops ceilings for a further and more in depth walk-through.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Through this, school officials have concluded that the thermostat created the problem - individuals would change the temperature frequently without realizing the implications. Keeping a constant temperature and deep cleaning affected areas are core elements of the solution to the outbreak. If it isn’t fixed, students will face health risks from the exposed fungi.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our schools are important too. We need to focus on the health of not only students, but also the school property itself. Keeping gyms, bathrooms, and classrooms clean will allow a more positive, fresh, and healthy environment for the students.

These TSA approved products make travelling a breeze and shampoo covered luggage almost impossible. Also, these products do not contain the harmful chemicals that traditional shampoos do, leaving your hair, and the Earth, sparkling clean.

                                London has officially topped Stockholm, Frankfurt, Singapore, New York, and Paris to officially be named the most sustainainable city in the world. The Arcadis’ Sustainable Cities Index, which evaluates a city holistically through three pillars (social, environmental, and economic), recently ranked the English metropolis as the number one city globally for environmental sustainability. While much of London’s success is driven by its ease of doing business, abundance of green space, and world class education, the city’s status may not be upheld for long, as increasing transportation congestion and high cost of living must be addressed to sustain long term competitiveness post-Brexit.

                            <h2><b> California’s First Step Towards Eliminating Plastic Straws</h2></b><br>
                            <h3> Collin Kelso </h3><br>
                            <time datetime="8-10-2019">AUGUST 10, 2019</time><br>
                            <p>
                                On September 20, 2018, Democratic Assemblyman Ian Calderon achieved California’s first step towards eradicating plastic straws when a bill outlining their statewide restriction was passed. This bill, California AB-1884, stated that sit-down restaurants were banned from providing customers with plastic straws except on request. While this bill may seem mundane, it is extremely important for the environment. That begs the question: why is this recent bill so important?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The answer is simple: a reduction in plastic straws would drastically reduce waste and massively improve the welfare of Earth’s oceans. According to Money.com, some scientists estimate that over seven million straws pollute U.S. shorelines alone. These straws lodge themselves into marine ecosystems, directly harming plants and animals in the process. Calderon directly cites this as the primary motive behind this law; he states that “we need to create awareness around the issue of one-time use plastic straws and its detrimental effects on our landfills, waterways, and oceans.” To put this legislation into effect, Calderon implemented steep penalties for businesses that did not adhere to it. According to the California Legislature, a fine of $25 will be incurred for every day that a violation is committed. While this bill aims to reduce the usage of plastic straws, it is not intended to be an outright ban; Calderon comments that “it is a small step towards curbing our reliance on these convenience products, which will hopefully contribute to a change in customer attitudes and usage.” Various towns and cities, including Davis, Calif. and San Luis Obispo, Calif., have already passed legislation to lower the prevalence of plastic straws. However, California AB-1884 affects the entire state, which allows statewide efforts to be made against plastic straws and other pollutants.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The provisions and motives backing California AB-1884 make it a highly effective law. To start, Calderon’s motives are committed to reducing the impact of plastic straws in marine environments. As this law passed with a majority vote, it shows that Californian officials share this sentiment. To back these motives, California AB-1884 imposes steep fines for violators, which encourages businesses to phase out straws or consider an alternative. Both of these factors encourage the state of California to reduce their plastic straw usage. While this law is not a fully comprehensive solution, one thing is certain: it is a step in the right direction.

                            <h2><b> White House Hides The Facts </h2> </b> <br>
                            <h3> Jadyn Cantrell </h3>
                            <time datetime="8-26-2019"> AUGUST 26, 2019</time><br>
                            <p>
                                Last month, the New York Times released an article detailing Dr. Rod Schoonover’s experience with the White House blocking his report on climate change and national security. At the time of the report, Schoonover was one of the senior analysts at the Bureau of Intelligence and Research of the State Department. His job focused on understanding and reporting the impact of climate change on national security to inform the millitary and intelligence agencies. In the article, Schoonover states that he had always enjoyed the apolitical nature of his job - even though he was presenting information to government agencies, the information he presented was never swayed or changed to fit the views of the administration that was in office. In other words, his job was to provide accurate, scientific, and unbiased information about climate change to the agencies that protect the United States.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, all of this changed in June of 2019 when the White House blocked his bureau’s written testimony on climate change to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The White House stated that “the scientific foundation of the analysis did not comport with the administration’s position on climate change.” After being permitted to appear before a hearing, Schoonover had just five minutes to summarize the eleven page testimony, being forced to leave out the scientific baseline of the overall message: “climate change will have wide-ranging implications for the U.S. national security over the next 20 years.” By blocking the testimony, the White House denied the “scientific integrity” and “analytical independence of an arm of the intelligence community.” This disappointing result not only led Schoonover to resign from his beloved job, it also brought forth important questions about the current administration. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To what extent can the White House deny our Nation’s protectors of important information? Does this hinder our ability to properly protect our country? Does this take away information Bureaus’ right to free speech to knowledge?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The answer to the last three questions is, frighteningly, yes. Trump’s administration refuses to believe statistics backed by millions of credible studies and statistics. In doing so, they put us all at risk of irreversibly destroying the planet. Whether Democrat or Republican, or something in between, the time to act on climate change is now. It can no longer be denied by world leaders who only seek to further themselves because, if we don’t act now, there won’t be any more world leaders. There won’t be any more world.

                                Even though humans are only one of the millions of organisms that habit the earth, they are the sole contributors to pushing the earth closer to its fatality. It is clear and obvious that the in the recent era, the direct contribution of humans to the demise of the environment can be heavily cited. From emerging use of mass transportation to invention of atomic warfare weapons to the destruction of natural habitats in favor of man-made ones, the effects of pollution are extremely clear and widespread. Thus as a result of this mass era of pollution scientists are trying to identify this era with a specific name and so far the proposal is to call it the anthropocene. Many scientists believe that by denoting our era with this nomenclature it will cause us to take the blame for such horrific effects seen in our environment. Many of these effects are in fact non-reversible and might even be able to be detected will into the future of the earth. It is up to us to take initiative and recognize the effects of toxic plastic waste and become more mindful of the environment around us.

                                I was recently reading about an interesting proposal to increase CO2 sequestration and thereby alleviate some of the issues caused by climate change on a smaller scale. This process works by taking advantage of the carbon-silicate cycle which is a way CO2 comes down with rain and then gets recycled back into the atmosphere. There are three major benefits of this project. First, olivine rock removes and stores carbon instead of letting it get recycled back to the atmosphere. Secondly, through the cycle ocean water is deacidified as the sulfate ions that are released help neutralize some of the ocean acidity caused by ocean acidification with CO2. Lastly, it fertilizes the ocean ecosystem by fostering diversity in animal species that otherwise would not be able to habitat these zones. You might be wondering why should be placing olivine on our beaches, especially warm high-energy shelfs. In order to release the sulfate ions in olivine, weathering must occur and warm high-energy tidal waves produced from these ideal shelves maximizes  weathering. Although the goal of this project seems far-fetched, if 2% of these shelves were thoroughly spread with olivine rock, it has been shown that a year's worth of CO2 emissions can be sequestrated.

                                Carbon dioxide is an integral part of biological processes that take place on the earth. The carbon cycle features processing in the earth’s geosphere, the life cycles of plants as well as humans and the change in content within the atmosphere. However, too much carbon dioxide within the atmosphere can be very detrimental towards the environment’s conditions. Because carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas (a gas that absorbs solar radiation), having too much of carbon dioxide can cause too much heat to be trapped in the earth’s atmosphere and thus overheating of the planet.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Based upon projections released by the International Energy Agency, “Peak carbon dioxide may be on the horizon” (Forbes). These projections are nowhere from surprising due to the abundance of fossil fuel pollution witnessed around the world. From vehicular emissions to manufacturing processes, the recent in usage of fossil fuels has resulted in a heavy rise of carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. However, due to the introduction of many pro-environmentalist agencies/interest groups as well as the heavy depletion of fossil fuel resources, many experts believe that some of these non-renewable resources have reached their peak and have begun a decline in usage. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For example, “coal is on its way out. The end of coal won’t happen anytime soon, but it does appear that nightmare scenarios of unmitigated expansion of coal burning are far less likely that recently assumed” (Forbes). Furthermore, there is surmounting evidence that the world is reaching a plateau in carbon dioxide emissions due to the commitments placed forward by policy-makers as “... he global carbon dioxide emissions two decades from now will be similar to what they are today” (Forbes). In conclusion, even though carbon dioxide emissions are reaching an alltime high, there is optimism that this exponential growth will subside due to the emerging work of pro-environmental agencies and climate impact studies.

                                The issue of global warming is commonly discussed, but its effects in the world are hard to pinpoint. Australia, however, has seen a large decline in ocean life and visible increases in temperatures that have resulted in bushfires and an extremely arid climate. Kelp forests, which used to be abundant in the cold Australian waters, have recently become brown clumped masses that can no longer support their former ocean communities. Additionally, scientists recently concluded that areas around the Earth should be held to a maximum increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius as compared to their pre-industrial standard, but the Tasman Sea around Australia is already way above that threshold. The result? A tremendous loss of fishing life and destruction of ocean communities beyond repair. The aboriginal Australian people who have depended on fishing to maintain their lifestyle have been forced to scramble for other alternatives to survive and the regional heat waves have caused lasting problems.

                                In mainland Australia, over 100 fires are burning in New South Wales with more than half out of control of firefighters. The smoke released from these bushfires can be felt in the air by residents of cities as far away as Melbourne. This along with the increasingly arid climate has led to many protesting against Prime Minister Scott Morrison. The Friday before Christmas was recorded as the hottest December day on record at 48 degrees Celsius or around 118.4 degrees Fahrenheit. The effects of these fires stretch to animal life also. Many marsupials, which Australia is famous for, have lost their homes and native habitats and have been forced to adapt to areas that they are not suited for. For species that can't, such as the giant kelp and many animals in fisheries, extinction has followed. 95% of all giant kelp has gone extinct around the world because of this issue.

                                It is time for us to consider how big of an issue we have at hand. The effects of carbon emissions from North America and China are causing irreversible changes in Australia and other countries that do not deserve such treatment. We must learn to reduce emissions and live more environmentally conscious lifestyle in order to preserve the one Earth we have and maximize our time here.

                                In the past century the usage of fossil fuels has risen dramatically to the point that many experts predict that we as a human populous will run out of these resources. As a result, many companies and famous people try to take pro-environment positions to gain the support of the public. For example, “Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have been very vocal about their efforts to reduce the world’s dependence on fossil fuels” (Vox). Such actions can be expected from worldwide monopolies as they are completely dependent on the demand created from their consumer base. However, while these companies preach heavy pro-environment talk in reality they have teamed up to extract ws much oil as possible. Even though there is continual advice from experts saying that fossil fuels are running out and dependence needs to decrease, the truth of the matter is that the human race continues to find new ways to extract oil. A key cog in this development is the evolution of technology over the recent years. The use of artificial intelligence and algorithms has proved to be essential in stimulating the discovery of new reserves. Furthermore, the development of better extracting tools such as advanced drills and pumps allows for the oil to be taken from the ground in a more fast and efficient manner. Overall, while the resource usage of the human population is at an all time high there is no reason to slow down at this point as more and more fossil fuels continue to be found.

                                In the recent century, global temperatures have increased dramatically due to increased usage of atmospheric degrading resources such as coal and natural gas. These global warming effects can be seen by visible changes in environments around the globe and thus represent the evolution of many terrains. For example, “Shrubs and grasses are springing up around Mount Everest and across the Himalayas, one of the most rapidly heating regions of the planet” (The Guardian). The region covering the Himalyan mountains is that of high elevation and colder temperatures. Thus many glaciers are present here as well as tundra biomes which support specific organisms and habitats. Reduction of glaciers and the resulting increase in vegetation would put the region in heavy threats for mass flooding which the region will be very unaccustomed to. Furthermore, the climate of the Himalyan mountain region might be reaching a tipping point where it will transform from a tundra environment to that of a polar grassland. Such transformations are alarming due to the fact that heavy portions of the water supply are stored in glacial layers and thus evaporation of these regions could raise the water levels too much thus increasing flooding. Overall, the situation witnessed in the Himalyan mountains is a reminder to the world that climate change is shifting our society in the wrong direction.

                                 In the last century, fossil fuel usage has skyrocketed in the form of exponential usage and has showed no signs of slowing down with the heavy profits associated with them. The trend to shift towards a more environmentally stable society is often put on the shoulders of policymakers as well as multinational corporations who have both the resources and support to bring about change. However, most of these credited officials and companies continue the high rates of fossil fuel usage due to the fact that there is so much profitability for all parties involved. Recent news has revealed though that, “ Microsoft Corp. unveiled plans to invest $1 billion to back companies and organizations working on technologies to remove or reduce carbon from the earth’s atmosphere, saying efforts to merely emit less carbon aren’t enough to prevent catastrophic climate change” (Los Angeles Times). Microsoft has come out and stated that this decade is when action needs to be taken against devastating carbon usage and they are 100% right. Even though, it is essential that we on the individual level try and limit our usage of such contaminants, that alone will not be close enough to stop the current paradigm shift of our environment. Big companies who control many aspects of everyday life across the world can make an impact by taking such a progressive step. The company plans to find effective methods of trapping higher quantities of the gas in underground reservoirs as well as shift towards the use of renewable energy. In fact, this action taken by microsoft can serve to inspire other multinational corporations to match their opposition in a move that allows them to stay on top of the market. Even though, the future looks bleak with the amount of pollutants being used every day, steps are being made to reverse such disasters and they are starting with the big names.

                                 Biodiversity is often seen as an afterthought in modern day society. Humans commonly believe that the only vital species is the human species and the exploiting and extinction of many animal species is necessary in order to gain profits. As a result, the exponential rise is fossil fuel usage and wildlife destruction within the last century have resulted in a significant drop in biodiversity across the globe. In fact, “over 100 locations where tropical forests and coral reefs have been affected by climate extremes, such as hurricanes, floods, heatwaves, droughts and fires'' (Lancaster University). Many of these climate extremes especially floods (stemming from poor agricultural practices leading to soil erosion) and drought (overuse of land turning a region into an arid region) are directly the contribution of human activity. The habitats that are most essential in supporting wildlife biodiversity are coral reefs and rainforests and these ecosystems are extremely susceptible to human induced changes. When a phenomenon such as overfishing or deforestation occurs, it is very difficult for an ecosystem to recover back to equilibrium levels. As a result  after each individual such disturbance, heavy levels of biodiversity are lost and the repeated occurrences lead to heavy accumulation of lost species. The only way to fix this issue is to make people “respect the local needs and diverse socio-ecological conditions in the tropics” (Lancaster University). The public needs to know that the majority of species across the globe are specialist species and that these organisms struggle to adapt to changing conditions. At the rate at which the human race is contaminating the earth, there will be a day where humans are the only species remaining on earth.

                            <h2><b> A Pressing Matter: the Dangers in the Gulf of Mexico’s Dead Zone </h2></b><br>
                            <h3> Evan H and Charan K </h3>
                            <time datetime="1-29-2020"> January 29th 2020 </time><br>
                            <p> 
                                The Dead Zone, an area devoid of life, covers over 6,000 square miles in the Gulf of Mexico, a sector practically the size of New Jersey.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This area sits between the delta of the Mississippi river and the upper Texas Coast, but it is not the only one. There are many others scattered across the globe in areas such as the Baltic Sea and Lake Erie. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What is a dead zone? A dead zone is an area in a large body of water where there is practically no oxygen. As a result, any life form requiring oxygen that makes the mistake of venturing into such zones is met with instant death.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What causes dead zones to form? Primarily, farming practices that add an overabundance of nutrients into the soil have been a major contributor to these dead zones. Nutrient runoff from states stretching from Wisconsin down to Mississippi feed into the Mississippi River. With the addition of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, there has been a rapid growth in algae. This alarming growth depletes dissolved oxygen. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since we know what is causing the issues in the Gulf of Mexico what can we do to fix them? First, we know that fertilizer is a large contributor to the dead zones. By reducing the amount of fertilizer and adjusting the timing of its application seasonally, we can limit the runoff of excess nutrients from the farmlands. The major issue is that many farmers do not know about the problems fertilizers bring and focus on the production and growth of their crops. Along with that, they do not really control animal wastes that are excreted on their farms. Animal wastes have organic matter such as proteins, carbohydrates, and nitrates, which flow into waterways and result in issues such as dead zones. Additionally, the industrial industry is a large contributor to the problem at hand. Through careful monitoring and practices, such as limiting the discharge of nutrients, chemicals, and organic matter from manufacturing facilities and farmlands, we can focus on improving the Gulf of Mexico in the future.

                            <p> 
                               An area that most of us will probably never visit is probably the most important zone in the world for preventing climate change. A study published in Geopolitical Research Letters found that losing the Arctic’s reflective summer ice would be equivalent to an extra 25 years of emissions, pushing us past the point of no return. In order to tackle this complicated issue, let’s explore the problems and solutions that pertain to this critical area.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Of course, protecting this all-important ice layer involves reducing CO2 emissions, but that is not enough. Super-pollutants, such as black carbon, methane, and hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants are multiple times more potent than carbon dioxide. Strict regulations are required to make sure that these damaging substances do not reach the Arctic - California provides a prime example where they were able to cut black carbon emissions by 90% by using strict guidelines. California is also legislating limits on methane released from landfills and strict regulations on refrigerants used in consumer products.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Innovation is also providing new solutions to the Arctic crisis. A non-profit called Ice911 plans to cover ice with a type of sand to increase the reflectivity of Arctic ice. Although these plans seem to be effective and risk-free, they have not been implemented yet. In order to protect the all-important ice, innovative solutions such as these should be rapidly tested and eventually rolled out on a large scale. An even more innovative approach is to insert sulfates into the atmosphere to reflect solar radiation, although implementation of this is far off.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now is the time to take action towards saving the Arctic. Winning this battle is the only way that we have a chance to win the war against climate change.

                            <h3> Charan Kotrike </h3>
                            <time datetime="2-19-2020"> February 19th 2020 </time><br>
                            <p> 
                               Biodiversity is critical to the rich variety of life that surrounds us. All too often, we take all of biology’s wondrous variations for granted, and ignore the fact that they are under attack every single day.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Species all around the world are rapidly going extinct due to human activities such as poaching, habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change. This begs the question: how does it really affect us in the long run?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                First, it comes at an economic cost. When human activity ruins a habitat, it causes the surrounding ecosystem to become dysfunctional. For example, one effect of deforestation is the erosion of soil into waterways, because tree roots contribute to the stability of the soil. This results in a decrease in food yields and a reduction in land quality. A recent analysis has found that this type of erosion, directly caused by our own deforestation, costs our economy eight billion dollars annually!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another consequence  is the spread of pathogens and disease. Primarily, when biodiversity decreases, the number of animals with diseases in local populations increases. Research has shown that the species who survive in critically fragmented habitats are prone to be prolific carriers of pathogens. With the habitat fragmentation that we are causing, humans are often too close to these carriers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are steps that we can take to preserve biodiversity. Even though lumber is an important part of our economy, we can work towards planting more trees than we cut. By saving trees around the world, we are essentially preventing water pollution, saving money to clean the water, as well as preventing habitat loss and spread of disease. Poaching is the second issue that we must address. The less we poach, the more species around the world can thrive, keeping food chains and ecosystem interactions as intact as possible. By doing this, we are preventing the need for species to migrate to new environments, where they will act as predators and carriers of pathogens. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is our job to act now to keep our ecosystems intact.

                               The people of the city of Chicago live with a dangerous neighbor. The neighboring Great Lakes keep rising as they are entering a new era of volatility. The last five years have been the wettest in history for the Great Lakes watershed, which encompasses eight states. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This rising threat has not gone unnoticed. The city of Chicago has installed flood barriers surrounding lakefronts, while New York plans to spend $300 million on protective measures to reduce flooding along the south shore of Lake Ontario. The Governor of Wisconsin has asked President Trump to designate the areas damaged by Lake Michigan’s flooding a federal disaster zone.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For people who live in these communities, it isn’t as simple as signing a bill. Communities are making decisions about how to protect themselves from a potential catastrophe, but this will come at a cost to taxpayers. Particularly, older areas have built their homes far too close to water. Although they were able to survive during times of low water levels and the flooding of the 1980s, it seems unlikely they will be able to continue forward as weather patterns change.

                                The strife that these communities are in is directly caused by climate change. As temperatures increase due to human-caused warming, the atmosphere can hold more moisture, causing severe storms. These events have drenched the Great Lakes region throughout the past summer and fall.

                                When discussing issues such as climate change, we often get carried away thinking about long term goals that seem unattainable now. However, global warming is having serious, concrete effects in communities close to us, which is why it is more important than ever to do everything we can to prevent future crises.

                               	Mining needs to become more environmentally-friendly.  Although the global economy depends on these mined resources, mining only serves as a temporary solution as the minerals mined are non-renewable resources. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although preserving the environment is one of the top priorities now, that was not always the case. Over the past two centuries, scientists that developed new mining technologies never gave environmental sustainability any consideration. Mining poses a threat to nearby bodies of water. As soil erosion increases due to the loosening of soil caused by mining, sediment can collect in streambeds, “suffocating” the wildlife present. In addition,  the waste from mines is acidic and can lower the overall PH of the body of water significantly, devastating the wildlife present.

                                 Wildlife is not the only one affected by mining. Mining loosens soil and encourages erosion. Many of these particles become airborne and can contain many toxic substances used in mining such as cadmium. These particles have linked to many adverse health effects on people and animals, impacting the ecosystems and our interaction with them.

                            <p>
                                The health effects range from respiratory tract diseases to cardiovascular diseases and asthma. Other diseases caused by unsafe water include cholera, giardia, and typhoid. Chemicals such as arsenic, pesticides, and nitrates can mix into the water, putting infants and pregnant women at the greatest risk.
                               Water-borne pathogens also pose a risk to us. To bluntly put into perspective, water pollution killed 1.8 million people in 2015 and sickens a billion people annually. Furthermore, the people mostly getting affected are low-income citizens who live near industrial sites that cause the pollution. However,  even wealthy first-world countries such as the United States struggle with keeping its water supply clean. Thousands of Legionnaire disease cases spring up every year in the U.S.

                                It is known that ecosystems are an intricate web consisting of animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, and interactions between biotic and abiotic things. By disrupting any of these, the web that was once created in a sturdy fashion will topple, impacting the ecosystem as a whole.

                               As a result of sweeping regulations due to the prevalence of the novel coronavirus, CO2 emissions and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have decreased drastically. The European Space Agency monitored concentrations of NO2 or nitrogen dioxide, and between Jan 1 and March 12, areas of Italy that were hit harder by COVID-19 were correlated with lower nitrogen dioxide levels. This was obviously caused by a larger decline in car traffic in the harder hit areas. Although this drop in emissions may seem promising, experts warn that this drop will only last as long as the world economies are depressed, which seems temporary. Italy's drop in emissions is promising for other countries in the EU and around the world who can hopefully follow their lead in instituting reforms and making climate change education mandatory in schools, to improve awareness and citizen involvement in preserving the environment. Hopefully you and your family can stay safe during these uncertain times!
