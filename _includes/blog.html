                            <h3> Bailey Hirota</h3><br>

                                It’s no secret that the environment is in danger. Prevent further degradation by switching to a more sustainable lifestyle. Small changes, although seemingly negligible, can contribute to great change over sustained periods of time. We only have one earth; we should do our best to return it to an abundant, vibrant state as soon as possible. And that begins with us. 
                            </p> 
              
                                <h3>Purposeful Shopping</h3>
                            <p>
                                The old saying “reduce, reuse, recycle” still holds true today. Every product has an “environmental footprint,” which includes the materials needed to create it to the pollution emitted during the manufacturing process to the packaging that is eventually relocated to landfills. Before buying something, ask yourself, “Do I really need this?”. Ensuring each purchase is necessary will both save money and reduce environmental footprint. 
                            </p>
                                <h3> Make sure big purchases have big environmental benefits</h3>
                            <p>    
                                When car shopping, consider fuel-efficient models - not only will you save thousands in gas money, but you will also drastically reduce your carbon footprint over the years. If you’re looking to buy a refrigerator, washer, dryer, or microwave, be aware of Energy Star labels to help you find the most efficient, energy saving appliances. For new water heaters, upgrade to solar.
                            </p>     
                                <h3> Go plastic free - #standagainstplastic</h3>
                            <p>    
                                With a 1000 year decomposition time, plastic never really just 'goes away.' Today, it accounts for just over 40% of the world's ocean surface. Numerous marine mammals are killed after ingesting or being impaled by plastic. Implementing plastic-free habits in your daily life, such as using reusable shopping bags, water bottles, and straws, and supporting brands that are sustainable, can help to reduce plastic pollution.
                            </p>   
                                <h3> Pay attention to labels</h3>
                            <p>     
                                Similar to #3, buying goods that are Fair Trade, organic, or "shade-grown" can contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle. "Shade-grown" coffee is grown while keeping forest habitats intact for migratory birds and other species. Fair Trade certified goods support companies dedicated to sustainable production and fair wages. Organic foods help to keep harmful pesticides out, protecting workers, wildlife, and the environment. 
                            </p>     
                                <h3> Mindful Eating</h3>
                            <p>   
                                 Meat production is undoubtedly one of the most environmentally destructive industries on the planet. It is also a major contributor to pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and habitat destruction. Each day, we can contribute to a reduced environmental footprint - and each time we eat, we can choose to improve the health of the planet by reducing our meat intake. In addition, around 40% of edible food in the US is wasted. Smart, planned shopping and a well devised meal plan can ensure complete use of the foods you purchase.

                                Interest in environmental conservation has grown rapidly. People have been attempting to find more sustainable plastic alternatives, from avocado seed straws to metals straws and reusable bottles. This surgance has been astronomically helpful in raising awareness; however, there are still many people who refuse to change their destructive ways. They are insistent on the fact that climate change is not real and that our plastic consumption doesn’t matter in the long run.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are many arguments used by climate change deniers. According to Business Insider, approximately 33% of deniers say that the weather has not changed around them, 18% say that the temperature varies naturally, another 12% state that there is conflicting or insufficient scientific evidence, and 5% of deniers state that the news reports and research are false. These deniers have a great amount of influence in the business sector, where the majority of the plastics pollutants come from. What is needed is proof that sustainability is more efficient and more profitable. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                According to Business Queensland, there are many ways that an environmentally conscientious business is profitable. There are three main points: <br>
                                   <b>Recycling reduces costs                  </b><br>   If one were to use reusable products, there would be reduced materials expenses, since making or buying things like plastic utensils and straws would not be necessary.
                                   <b>Green practices can attract new customers</b><br>   Businesses that are known to be environmentally conscientious are more likely to attract customers, in general, than non-environmentally friendly businesses. <br>
                                   <b>Improves Sustainability                  </b><br>   If a business is less reliant on resources like plastic, they will beat out their competitors when prices rise due to climate change. Furthermore, they are more likely to comply with future legislation.

                             <h2><b> 5 Interesting Books on the Climate Crisis Everyone Should Read</h2></b><br>
                             <h3> Tovah Negus</h3><br>
                             <time datetime="7-31-2019">JULY 31, 2019</time><br>
                             <p>
                                 It’s no secret that climate change is one of the world’s most pressing issues. With an estimated 11 years left before irreversible climate change and the continued lack of global awareness, the outlook is bleak. Many blame the current scale of the climate crisis on the lack of political action; however, legislation tends to follow public opinion, as politicians often back trends that garner the most support. This means that educated individuals who guide others can in turn influence the politicians responsible for such legislation in the first place. Sounds great, right? Here are some books to get you started.

                            <h3> Kaitlyn Duffy</h3><br>
                            <time datetime="7-31-2019">JULY 31, 2019</time>
                            <p>
                                Thirty-three public schools in Howard County were recognized for mold outbreaks in locker rooms, gyms, and athletic storage closets. This wasn’t a first - in 2016, there were exactly twelve Howard County schools that had higher level molds than what was expected. Now, the complaints from students and faculty have rolled in once again.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The main sources of the outbreaks are athletic departments, like locker rooms, and sports gear, such as helmets, volleyballs, and swim caps. Some schools involved are Ellicott Mills Middle School, Lime Kiln Middle School, River Hill High School, Hammond Elementary, and Northfield Elementary. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Mold growing is a definite health hazard. The effects of mold include asthma, allergic reactions, and irritation in the eyes, nose, throat, lungs, and skin. Health guideline officials have taken notice and have investigated janitors and staff members that may be held responsible for involvement in the outbreak. For containment, strict procedures have been established. First, IEQ officials review each school by doing walk-throughs. Then, the Office of Environment contacts each official who submits a concern, and lastly, a school hygienist drops ceilings for a further and more in depth walk-through.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Through this, school officials have concluded that the thermostat created the problem - individuals would change the temperature frequently without realizing the implications. Keeping a constant temperature and deep cleaning affected areas are core elements of the solution to the outbreak. If it isn’t fixed, students will face health risks from the exposed fungi.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our schools are important too. We need to focus on the health of not only students, but also the school property itself. Keeping gyms, bathrooms, and classrooms clean will allow a more positive, fresh, and healthy environment for the students.

These TSA approved products make travelling a breeze and shampoo covered luggage almost impossible. Also, these products do not contain the harmful chemicals that traditional shampoos do, leaving your hair, and the Earth, sparkling clean.

                                London has officially topped Stockholm, Frankfurt, Singapore, New York, and Paris to officially be named the most sustainainable city in the world. The Arcadis’ Sustainable Cities Index, which evaluates a city holistically through three pillars (social, environmental, and economic), recently ranked the English metropolis as the number one city globally for environmental sustainability. While much of London’s success is driven by its ease of doing business, abundance of green space, and world class education, the city’s status may not be upheld for long, as increasing transportation congestion and high cost of living must be addressed to sustain long term competitiveness post-Brexit.

                            <h3> Collin Kelso </h3><br>

                                On September 20, 2018, Democratic Assemblyman Ian Calderon achieved California’s first step towards eradicating plastic straws when a bill outlining their statewide restriction was passed. This bill, California AB-1884, stated that sit-down restaurants were banned from providing customers with plastic straws except on request. While this bill may seem mundane, it is extremely important for the environment. That begs the question: why is this recent bill so important?

                                The answer is simple: a reduction in plastic straws would drastically reduce waste and massively improve the welfare of Earth’s oceans. According to Money.com, some scientists estimate that over seven million straws pollute U.S. shorelines alone. These straws lodge themselves into marine ecosystems, directly harming plants and animals in the process. Calderon directly cites this as the primary motive behind this law; he states that “we need to create awareness around the issue of one-time use plastic straws and its detrimental effects on our landfills, waterways, and oceans.” To put this legislation into effect, Calderon implemented steep penalties for businesses that did not adhere to it. According to the California Legislature, a fine of $25 will be incurred for every day that a violation is committed. While this bill aims to reduce the usage of plastic straws, it is not intended to be an outright ban; Calderon comments that “it is a small step towards curbing our reliance on these convenience products, which will hopefully contribute to a change in customer attitudes and usage.” Various towns and cities, including Davis, Calif. and San Luis Obispo, Calif., have already passed legislation to lower the prevalence of plastic straws. However, California AB-1884 affects the entire state, which allows statewide efforts to be made against plastic straws and other pollutants.

                                The provisions and motives backing California AB-1884 make it a highly effective law. To start, Calderon’s motives are committed to reducing the impact of plastic straws in marine environments. As this law passed with a majority vote, it shows that Californian officials share this sentiment. To back these motives, California AB-1884 imposes steep fines for violators, which encourages businesses to phase out straws or consider an alternative. Both of these factors encourage the state of California to reduce their plastic straw usage. While this law is not a fully comprehensive solution, one thing is certain: it is a step in the right direction.
