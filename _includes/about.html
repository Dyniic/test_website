                    <p>
                    Hello! My name is Alyssa, and I enjoy creating products and services that people can use. I graduated with a background in Business (dual major in Accounting and Information Systems) and a minor in Creative Writing, and througout the time, I knew I wanted to pursue a career that exercises my creativity while solving puzzles.</p>  

                    <p> After taking a few classes in HTML/CSS and SQL, I realized that I enjoyed it. The internship experience gave me the extra push in pursuing the career as well. I've had the privilege of working at a healthcare industy where I gained more programming experience.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>I'm currently working with Hack for Los Angeles, a Civic Tech Organization, on the organization's website and guide pages. I'm always interested in creating applications that improves people's lives.</p>
