description: Clean water. Safe housing. Nutritious food. Esperança envisions a world in which the foundations of health and wellbeing are available to people everywhere. For more than four decades it has joined with communities worldwide, providing tools, training, and support necessary to help them reach that goal. Transforming lives around the globe Esperança champions compassion, service to others, and the dignity of every human being. But it places equal emphasis on practical values such as effectiveness, efficiency, transparency, and sound fiscal stewardship. More than 94% of Esperança‘s expenses go directly to program services. Founded in 1970 by Father Luke Tupper — a medical school graduate and ex-US Navy seaman turned Jesuit missionary — Esperança supports surgical teams and funds food-related microbusinesses across the Americas and in Africa. It helps communities dig wells and build water systems, provides health education and medical screening, and directly touches the lives of millions.
