description: In 2010 as part of the Mongol Rally, we raised money for MSF, Doctors Without Borders. MSF is a French secular humanitarian-aid non-governmental organization, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, best known for its projects in war-torn regions and developing countries facing endemic diseases. Started in 1971, this organization has been at the forefront of providing humanitarian aid in the face of both political and environmental instability.
