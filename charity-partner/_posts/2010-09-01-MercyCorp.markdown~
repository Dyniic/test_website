description: In 2010, as part of the Mongol Rally, we raised money for Mercycorp. Started in 1979, and headquartered in Seattle, Mercycorp is a global aid agency engaged in transitional environments that have experienced natural disaster, economic collapse, or conflict. People working for it move as quickly as possible from bringing in food and supplies to enabling people to rebuild their economy with community-driven and market-led programs.
