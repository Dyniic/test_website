description: For the 2012 Timbuktu Challenge, Team MMT partnered with the Salif Keita foundation to donate an ambulance to a hospital operating in Mali. The Salif Keita Foundation was founded by Salif Keita, a Malian born singer, and is focused on addressing the plight of albinos in both Mali and Africa as a whole. Given the many medical challenges that albinos face, the foundation is particularly knowledgeable about ongoing projects in Mali and their advice to Team MMT has been invaluable. The vehicle was successfully donated to the Center for Development of Vaccine where it was to be converted into mobile health clinic to deliver health services to villages in remote areas.
