description: For the Timbuktu Challenge, Team MMT collaborated and promoted The Mali Health Organizing Project. Founded in 2007, MHOP is non profit organization that focuses on organizing child and maternal health projects to transform communities at the grass roots level. MHOP operates in Sikoro, a slum in the outskirts of Bamako. There, MHOP has setup a health clinic, a health radio show, leadership training programs, and maternal and child services for the poor. Team Last Responders raised money to support the good work that MHOP does and to deliver supplies to MHOPâ€™s offices on the ground to assist their operation.
