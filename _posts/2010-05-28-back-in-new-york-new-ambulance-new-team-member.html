I've returned to New York after a week long visit to Berlin. Mission
Ambulance Acquisition was simple: check, purchase, and register the car. What
ended up happening was completely unexpected - ending with an emergency train
ticket back to Berlin from Leipzig, a delayed flight out of Berlin, and the
airport ground crew going on strike, causing my luggage to be misplaced.

Also, I'd like to report that we backed out of Lenon, the original car
that we've decided to get. We ended up selecting a different, older, yet
to be named, better maintained car. I'd also like to report that we have
a new Team Member: Lillian Wilde!

In other news:
Unfortunately due to some issues with the Tshirt printers, the pre-production samples never arrived. Looks like the Tshirts will be delay a week.

Right now we're scrambling to get visas, to finish the purchase, and to
raise funds. We've all dropped off our applications to the Kazakhstan Visa. Mine is scheduled to be ready by Tuesday.
