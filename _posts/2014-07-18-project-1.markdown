description: This is a responsive main front page for a woodworking, cabinet, kitchen, bathroom, design or other shop. Bootstrap was used as a base CSS but I would not say this site looks like a typical Bootstrap site. I also used Yeoman, Grunt, Bower to develop and build the site. This was developed as practice for using HTML/CSS/Javascript/jQuery skills.
