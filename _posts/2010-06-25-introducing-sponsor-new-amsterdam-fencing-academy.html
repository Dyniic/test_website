Magical Mongolian Mystery Tour is thrilled to announce that New Amsterdam
Fencing Academy has signed on to sponsor our team!

![NAFA](/img/2010-mongolrally/posts/logo_nafa_200.jpg){:width="50%"}

Originally established in the year 2000 as Salle Gitane, NAFA has grown from a handful of students into a constantly expanding, full-time fencing club. NAFA has a distinctive program–modeled after some of the most successful systems in Europe–that emphasizes group training along with individual lessons. For kids, NAFA is a wonderful place to improve fitness, develop mental acuity, and have fun. For adults, it is a great place to learn a new sport or, for the experienced competitor, vastly improve one’s abilities.
