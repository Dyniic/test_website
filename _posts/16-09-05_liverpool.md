Dear Friends,

[Picture of me.]

As I start writing this message, I am sitting in the passenger seat of our adventure ready Nissan Versa. We are driving from Liverpool to London for final preparations before setting off toward India. The rest stations here are called "Welcome Break". They're pretty similar to American rest stops except you can get fish and chips if you don't like Burger King and Subway.

Earlier in the week, a Londoner warned us to be careful in Liverpool. He went on to say that port cities like Liverpool are hotbeds for crime and vice. I must say that our stay didn't exactly reflect his description at all. People were friendly and welcoming. Everywhere we walked, we saw murals of the Beatles and statues of their members. The car pickup was hassle-free. Funny enough, the Liverpool Port security officer accompanying us to our car was once a London police officer. I put the question to him and asked if there was any truth to the Londoner's warning. The ex-officer had a lot to say about crime, but he assured us that tourists have nothing to fear from port crime. The type of crime that visiting tourists should worry about are petty crime like theft and robberies, which London's got Liverpool beat by a long shot.

Driving from London to Mumbai will take us through countries that require visas, special car permits, and in couple instances, government approved "guides" to watch us. It's a lot of work. When we started, I figured the likelihood of another group launching on the same day, from the same place, and headed to the same place would be pretty small. I was wrong - there are 2 other teams.

First, there's us - Team Last Responders. Our team consists of 3 members: Kunal Modi, Devanshi Ghandi Modi, and me. We originally had a 4th Londoner member, but she dropped out a couple months back. We are driving Kunal's personal 2009 Nissan Versa, which will be shipped back to Newark from India. The project is self financed. Money raised goes to the India based charity 'Kedi School'. Team lead Kunal Modi, is a Software Development Manager at Amazon. He lives in Jersey City and grew up in Mumbai. I recruited Kunal to join me from London to Mali 4 years ago. Ever since that trip, Kunal's been yearning for another adventure. Kunal's wife Devanshi is a traveller noob. Her first time on a plane was 2 years ago when she immigrated to USA from India. She got her driving license 3 months ago. This will surely be an eye opener for her. Finally, there's me. This will be my 3rd rally. For the first time, I'm taking a back seat from leading. This time around, I get to sit back and watch someone else sweat it out when shit hits the fan.

The next team is headed by Mr Raj Karadian. At 65, Raj is the youngest member of this 3 man team. His teammates include a 68 year old retired bus driver and a 72 year old retired cook. For all my trips, I've settled on instant noodles for dinner every day. I've never had a professional cook on the team. Raj says they plan to bring enough flour to eat fresh baked Roti for the entire journey. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't jealous.

Team Raj's 1997 Fiat camper van beats our car in space and creature comforts. It has a fully operational kitchen, a bathroom with a hot shower, and enough sleeping space for 5. But to Raj, the most important thing about his vehicle is the liquor cabinet. Raj mentioned several times that their daily booze budget is 40 dollars. For this team, driving stops promptly at 4:30 and the bar opens at 5pm sharp, *every day*. 10,000 miles on the road, 1 fully stocked liquor cabinet, and 3 retired old Gujrati gentlemen looking to cross off an item off their bucket list: now that's a recipe for some stories.

Team three is Bharulata Kamble. Bharulata is driving by herself, and is promoting the idea that she will be setting a world record by driving her BMW X3. According to her press releases (yes, she has press releases), she will be the first Indian Woman to drive from London to Mumbai solo. I wasn't aware that there was a record category for that. Maybe we can claim a record for the first Indian Chinese American team to drive the distance in a 2009 Nisan Versa. Anyway, out of the 3 teams, Bharulata has the largest media footprint, the largest support team, and the newest car. She has appeared on UK TV, Radio and new papers. Her 15,000 Facebook following dwarfs the Last Responders's paltry 800.

A couple months ago, there was a face to face meeting between Bharulata, Raj, and our 4th teammate. On our side, we were looking to share information and  see if there was an opportunity to coordinate. The impression of Bharulata after the meeting was that she was only keen on promoting her project. She didn't share any project details. She basically spent the meeting listing all her awards, accomplishments, and important contacts like a politician campaigning for office. In the following weeks, we discovered that Bharulata copied our project by adding Kedi School to her list of charities. She even cut and pasted text from our website!

Team Bharulata kinda makes me think of Team Trump. They are both extremely skilled in marketing themselves. They both dodge details in what they say. And they both seem pretty comfortable cutting pasting other people's words.

So those are the 3 teams. My money is on Team Last Responders crossing the finish line first.

Cheers,
Stephen




I haven't met her personally, but from what I gather she's a dogged and determined spotlight hunter. She kinda reminds me of how people describe Donald Trump. Like Donald, she's great at promoting herself. If you read her bio, she describes herself as multi talented from fashion model, design, philanthopist, activist. She even pulled a Melanie Trump by copying our charity, and cutting, pasting, and rearranging the text that Kunal wrote for Kedi school, the charity we're supporting. The consensus is that Bharulata is a spotlight hunter and is silling to do. Now i don't think that is inherently a problem, but with the following she commands,

Hope all is well,
Stephen

She. She's unwilling to share teh details of her plans but goes
Like Trump, she's not too big on details. She even
Originally, i believe her objective was to get a spot in the Guiness Book of World Records as the first Indian woman to drive solo from London to India. Bharulata's  amazing skill is self-promotion and spin.

 he has a signifigant Social Media presence with about 15K likes.
Her website indicates that for this project, she's received the endorcement of her religous community, her toen mayor, british MPs and Indian MP's.
She has appeared in the NYTimes of India nad ITV.
But according to accounts, by raj, the impression is that she's really focused on promoting her own intersts.
When she was approached by others to collaborate on sorting out logistics, she tended to clam up.

From what I gather, she went to law school but appears to have an interest in politics.
Not sure if she practices law, but her bio suggests that she studied law.
I have yet to personally meet Bharulata, but the consesus from people who have seem to indicate that she's really good at promoting herself and her interests, but a little weak on technical details.

The best I can describe this team is....team Trump. Poltics aside.

I've never met Bharulata, but so far I've met three people who have.
I put solo in quotes because while she is driving alone, she has a huge support team.
According to her FB page, she Cheif coordintor, spokes person, GM, Logistics manager, support officer.
I havent met Mrs Barulatha Kamle, but I met 2 people that have.
I would summarize their Barulatha as "Trumpy".

They description of her, I would best describe this team as "Team Trump". The general impression that people came away is that she's generally interested in advancing her own interests, and not so open to collaborate and detailed information. She had done a great job promoting herself and . He has appeared on TV and the news paper several time. But when Raj pressed her on details of her how she's planning to cross the border, or apply for permits to cross into countries, she tended to dodge the question. My guess is that Barulatha has a team of people working for her and either doesn't really know the details of the planning, or she knows but is unwilling to say because she plans on cutting some corners. She

from what I hear her team is best described as "Team Trump". If you look at Barulata has done a great job promoting her project by getting a regocnition from PM's and

Team B is a solo team...sorta. I say "sorta" because while the driving team is 1 Barulatha Kamle, she really has en entire support staff around her doing PR, Marketing, and fundraising.  I didn't get a chance to meet Barulatha Pomley, but i've heard a whole lot about her. It seems like her main skill in all this is self promotion.


 I don't know the details of who the other members are, but the other 2 members are 68 and 72.

Raj is of indian descent but was born in Kenya. Raj does not hesitate to mention that his level of education did not pass 10th grade.

The second team is a solo team.

As of Sept 8, Team Last Responders is in Liga, Team A just crossed into Russia, and Team B is back in Paris.






Team Space Cowboys:

If you haven't seen the movie "Space Cowboys", its a movie where NASA calls a bunch of over the hill astronauts to save the day.
Well, in reference to that movie, I decided to call this guys "Team Space Cowboys".
Last week, I met their team leader Raj Karadian, who lives in Leicester.
At 65, Raj is the youngest member of their team. The other two are 68 and 72. The main skill that Raj brings to the table is determination.
He's been planning this trip for 3 years but every year something came up.
2 years ago his teammate had a medical problem and dropped out.
last year the nepal earthquake stopped everything.
but this year he's good to go.
It's worth mentioning that he's from a generation isn't too computer savvy. He's got reams and reams of plans, maps and spreadsheets. His teammates

The other two members are 68 and 72. I'm not sure which is witch, but . Their camper van is fully equipt with hot shower, running toilet, and a 5 burner stove. The team is ready to whip up a mean and drive. In many regards, i think this is the perfect team.

One teammate is a retired bus driver making him the perfect designated driver for the journey. The second teammate was a cook in a restaurant. Team G may be a bit over the hill, but they got alot of bases covered: food, driving, mechanic. They all have a healthy appetite for drinking too.

Team Trump:



Hanging out with indians has been prety interesting. First the types of food they each. Some of the opinions have leaked out. One thing that I notivced is that every single dish seems to comprise of a large variety of spices grains and vegtables. For example, Kunal made a sandwich yesterday. The filling was made of Potate, mashed peas, onion, Cumin, and a variety of other spices. My hosts whether it was typical to always have such a large variety of vegtables and things. They went on further to say that only poor and impoverished people would just eat bread. I asked if my customary baguette and cheese would be considered. Their response was that such foods would be considered food unfit for normal people.

Anyway, there have been another development. It turns out that there are 2 other travellers driving the same distance from London to Mumbai. Not only that, everyone was scheduled to launch on the same day, August 28. I can't imagine the probability of this being a coincidence, but i suppose it is.

Each team cannot be more different.

Forst of course is our team. Kunal modi and Devanshi Ghandi Modi.

The first team is spearheaded by Raj Karadia. Raj is a colorful character. He's 65 and has been thinking about doing this road trip for the past couple years. 3 years, ago he was supposed to launch, but then the nepal border happene, the border closed and then. This year he's determined to complete the journey and managed to recruit 2 others to do it. The first is a 72 year old chef. the second

Parulatha. This woman can best be described as a self serving politician type.

I didn't expect to be driving along side 2 other teams. Officially, we have nothing to do with each other. But I


I find it hard to believe that 3 teams are driving from London to Mumbai, India. But it's happening. Now I know that this isn't not officially a race, but I think it'll be hard to avoid the us vs them human nature.

There you have it. 3 teams, 3 objectives, 1 destination. Each team will have their own challenges. So far our team has been delayed a week. True, this isn't at all a race to the finish line. But I do think this will be a race to see who can actually complete their objectives.


Raj Karathia is a Kenyan born Indian. He is 65  He speaks English, Gujrathi, Swahili, and a mix of other African languages. Raj has been dreaming of this journey for the past couple years. His teammate includes a 68 year old retired Bus driver and a 72 year old retired chef. Earlier last week, we met him at his place in Leicester. There he gave us a tour of his vehicle. Raj will be driving a 20 year old Campervan with about 50K miles on it.

Barulatha Pomly is a 40 year old Barrister from UK. She too is indian. I'm not sure from where she comes, but

Finally, we, Last Responders are driving a Nissan Versa. Our team consists of Kunal Modi, an Engineering Manager at Amazon, and his wife Devanshi Modi, a physical therapist. Kunal came with me to Africa but he never crossed the finish line. For the past 4 years he's been dreaming of the chance to do this. Last November, he decided to start planning this trip.

Last we heard, the car is on schedule to be delivered on Friday, which means the earliest we car pickup the car is Monday. This one week delay will cost us about 1 week but we are keeen on

As I start writing this message, I am sitting in a bus en route to Heathrow from the Sheraton near Heathrow.
Expedia had advertised a low car rental price from Fox rental.
Things didn't exactly pan out that way.
Moments ago, when Kunal returned our rental car to Easirent car rental inspector circled the car and spotted a visible scratch on the left rear rim.
The admin came along and insisted that we be charged 150GBP.
So the cost went from an initial 120GBP for the week to 120+120+150 = 390GBP.
Kunal and Devanshi are pretty livid.
