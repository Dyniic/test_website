Fire on route

[]

Today we drove 8 hours to Lan Zhou, the birthplace of hand pulled noodles. The roads are smooth and the scenery there are moutains as far as the eye can se. I'm pleased to say as we drive toward the coast, and away from XinJiang, the rest stops have steadily impoved in quality and cleniness. Rest stops here serve freshly made hand pull noodles.

Economy, inequality

Night market with cool foods
