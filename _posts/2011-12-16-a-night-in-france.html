<p>A night in France.</p>
<p>We just got off the ferry at Calais, France from Dover,UK.<br />
I was driving and started looking for signs to Paris. For the first time I realized l was in France when the signs read 'sortie', 'rappel'. Myself nor my teammates know French. "Driving through non english speaking contries is going to be tough without a GPS.", I mummered to myself. But again, most countries on our route are non english speaking. Soon I saw a sign for 'Paris 347km', followed the road and thoughts came to rest. I was relieved I could follow the sign.</p>
<p>An hour into France the fuel tank altered for more diesel. It read "airre de something something". But the food, fuel and parking signs are universal everywhere. I drive towards a gas station and try to figure out the process. Again all instructions on the pump are in French. I see convenient store cum gas station right across. I walk up to the window and the lady greets in French. I replied "Hi". I pointed to fuel and handed 60 Euros. I pumped in gas and we are all set. I realized I could pump in another 40 Euros worth of gas. I run up to the desk and give the lady 40 Euros. Then she starts saying something pointing to the pump but I insist on she giving me a receipt for the money. Again she says something and I only say "Receipt, please". Of all the words she was speaking, word "Pistol" or "Piston" fell on my hears. I looked back where she was pointing and realized she wanted me to reset the pump so that the machine proceeds to print the receipt. I come back after doing that and she hands over me the receipt.</p>
<p>As I walked back towards the Ambulance, I reminded myself Language is always a medium for communication, it can never act as a barrier.</p>
