This morning, a man from Casablanca phoned Freya with news that the package was at the CTM bus station in Dakhla. Amazing! I could hardly believe it. Would it really be that simple?&#160; Would the package arrive on Wednesday when they said they would?
In a word, &ldquo; **no** &rdquo;
*At the package desk in the CTM bus station (pictured above)*

Freya: &ldquo;Hi my name is Freya McCall, I'm here to pick up a package&rdquo;

Man: &ldquo;We don't have a package for you&rdquo;

Freya: &ldquo;It was put on a bus this Monday, it should be here&rdquo;

Man: &ldquo;We don't have it, it's still in Casablanca.&rdquo;

Freya: &ldquo;Impossible I received a phone call from Casablanca 3 minutes ago. They told me it's here.&rdquo;

Man: &ldquo;it's not here&rdquo;

*We turn around, Freya phones Casablanca.*

Casa Man: &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;

Freya: &ldquo;Hi. My name is Freya McCall. We just got a phone call from you informing us that our package has arrived. We're at the bus station and ---&rdquo;

[on hold]

Man: &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;

Freya: &ldquo;Hi. My name is Freya McCall. I'm in Dakhla, and am expecting a package to arrive today. We got a phone call from you informing us that our package has arrived.&rdquo;

Man: &ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo;

Freya: &ldquo;The package was supposed to arrive here in Dakhla today&rdquo;

Man: &ldquo;Dakar?&rdquo;

Freya: &ldquo;No Dakhla&rdquo;

Man: &ldquo;Dakar?&rdquo;

Freya: &ldquo;Dakhla, Daklha&rdquo;

Man: &ldquo;Dakar?&rdquo;

Freya: &ldquo;DAKHLA!&rdquo;

Man: &ldquo;Um&hellip;Dakar?&rdquo;

[heated exchange]

*Freya hands the phone to the package man.*

*Package man and Casablanca Man go back and forth in French Arabic.*

Package Man: The package is in Casablanca.&#160; They'll put it on today's bus and it'll get here in 2 days, Friday.

So there you have it folks. Friday. Thanks Morocco.
