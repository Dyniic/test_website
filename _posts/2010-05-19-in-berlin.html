I've just arrived in Berlin. I'm here to check out the ambulance that we will
acquire to donate to Mongolia. The deadline to submit car registration
information is May 31st so I have about ten days to figure everything out. I've
given myself about one week to check&nbsp; the car (make sure it exists), make
the purchase and plan the next move.
