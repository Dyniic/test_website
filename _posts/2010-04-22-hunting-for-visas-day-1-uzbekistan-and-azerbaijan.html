Traveling through Uzbekistan requires Uzbek visas. According to the Uzbek
embassy website, imperialist Americans representatives pay a premium for a
visa that generally much cheaper for non-Americans. On the other hand, a
transit visas cost only $20. Given that we&#8217;re all pretty broke, we
decided to find out from the embassy exactly who we&#8217;d have to bribe to
get a transit visa.

After an unproductive visit to the Uzbek embassy that turned out to be open
only 2 hours out of the day, we stopped by the Azerbaijan Embassy. When we
arrived, like Uzbekistan, the sign stated that they worked only 2 hours out
of the day which totally bummed us out. But as we were about to leave, this
thin, Central Asian looking man dressed in T-shirt and slacks washing this
black Cadillac told us that the consulate door was open and that we should
just go in. Once inside, we immediately ran into 2 men in the back office
with  &#8220;Who the hell are these people?&#8221; written all over their
faces.
