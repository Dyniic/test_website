We spent the final days preparing for our departure in typical Last Responders fashion – everything done in the last minute until, no time for sleep.  Mike was pulling consecutive all-nighters to finish work. Dennis and Kunal were scrambling to buy basic stuff like backpacks, footwear, and sleeping bags.

While Dennis filled his bag with vodka and whiskey. Kunal is convinced that he needs to bring his own vegetarian food. His friends and myself are wondering how he’ll manage to bring 3 weeks worth of food. Last I heard,  Kunal is filling his bag with oatmeal, pasta sauce, and Indian snacks – how the combination of those three things will keep him going is beyond me.
