We are thrilled to announce that fund raising is going really well.  We have reached the event minimum requirement of 1000 UK pounds last  night and will now be raising money for MSF, aka Doctors Without  Borders. Given that we will be taking an ambulance across Europe and  Asia and the recent events in Haiti, Chile, and China, we felt that  adding a cause such as MSF would be a fitting.
