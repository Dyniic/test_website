We picked up a hitch hiker in London.I met Sasha Sherbakov while I was traveling through Irkutsk, Russia last year during the rally. Turned out he was living in London and headed toward Paris so we gave him a lift. In typical Last Responder style, we arrived in Paris at 5AM.

Dropped off Sasha at the train station
