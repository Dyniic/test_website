Last month, I returned to New York with high hopes that our newly selected
ambulance, fondly dubbed Penny Lane, would be taking us to Mongolia in German
VW style. After my &#8220;expert&#8221; 20 minute visual inspection, my heart
was set on Penny and I returned to home, declaring to the Mongol Rally
community that we would be driving a 1992 VW through the siberian tundra into
Mongolia.

We discovered in the following weeks that we stumbled into a treasure trove of
problems and trouble. It turned out that the Penny&#8217;s inspection sticker
expired long ago. We didn&#8217;t think that that would be a problem. We
anticipated that we would need a budget to repair the car, and figured it
wouldn&#8217;t be a big deal. Boy were we wrong. Let&#8217;s go in order
here&#8230;. In order for us to get plates for the car, we need to register the
car. You can&#8217;t register the car unless you get an inspection sticker. You
can&#8217;t get an inspection sticker unless the car is proven to be &#8220;
road worthy&#8221;. A car is &#8220;road worthy&#8221; only if the inspector
decrees that all items on the car are in working order. To identify all the
items that are not in working order, a mechanic needs to do a through
inspection. Now here&#8217;s where it all breaks down: the car dealer will not
allow our mechanic to thoroughly check the car to get an estimate on the repair
cost unless we buy the car. Bull. This essentially meant we could get stuck
with a repair bill that ran into the thousands and not fixing it meant we
couldn&#8217;t even get plates, let alone out of the city.

We decided last week that the risk was way too high and pulled out of the deal,
and immediately started scrambling to find an ambulance this week that already
had inspection sticker. We found one, but it was 5000 euros - double that of
the previous car, which drove me into hyper fund raising mode.

I&#8217;ve lost count as to how many unveiling i&#8217;ve done. But here it is,
the final (hopefully) unveiling of the Magical Mongolian Mystery Mobile:
