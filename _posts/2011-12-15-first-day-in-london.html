I was anticipating that Heathrow would lose my baggage like they did last time, but it didn&rsquo;t happen. I was anticipating that my teammates would hit a problem and be hours and hours late like last year, but that didn&rsquo;t happen either. So when Dennis and Mike found us at the airport at the designated spot, I was amazed that nothing catastrophic had happened &#8211; yet.

The plan to pickup our equipment at the UPS store started simple enough but turned into a 5 hour ordeal that took us to just about every single UPS center around London, each claiming that the next center should have our package. To make matters worse, the road layout in London is completely non-sensical. Roads of one name turn into&#160; another every couple blocks. Streets don&rsquo;t stay straight. When someone says, &ldquo;drive down this road and made a left&rdquo; that can take you in just about any direction.

We eventually arrived at the head UPS office in Feltham and parked our car into a parking spot fit only for compact cars. The front half of the ambulance stuck out like a sore thumb. But most importantly we managed to find the equipment we sent from New York. It only took 5 hours.
