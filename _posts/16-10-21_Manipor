Food took forever to arrive but eventually when it arrived it was pretty good.
We had to decide to depart tht day or next, we oped for today.
We started driving at around 3:00 only to discover that indian roads are pretty shitty
The drive took us into the night.
We didn't rally want to jeep going, but we had nowhere to stop.
Kunal looked pretty tense, saying that Assam is actually considered dangerous.
THere is alot of local resentment toward the presence of indian army.
Additionally, ther have been many reports of amry soldiers raping local women.
The pitch black roads was nerve wracking.
This time

First we reached Tenugapol, then we reached imphal, the capital of Manipor
My impression is that people are pretty selcoming

It wasn't late when we arrived

trains of cargo vans darting around
Army trucks riding up and down the road
potholes

This is a chaotic place
drivers are like get out of my way i'm coming, rather than beinh helpful


The final border crossing between Myanmar and India took place near a bridge connecting river. The bridge is painted yellow and white.

We arrived at the immigration. A man in surge shorts and a grin completed our immigration

The whole border crossing didn't tke very long. we start 1 am, crossed 1:37 4:22. Finally after several countires indaians gould eat indian foodI odered chicken biriyani.

[customs]

"America is sending a space ship to Mars and here I am transcribing numbers  by hand." sighed the raspy voiced custom official on the Indian side of the Myanmar border. Mr Singh had quite the sense of humor about the fact that he was surrounded by obsolescence. I don't think I've ever seen a wooden walk-through metal-detector. The solid steel luggage scanner sat in the middle of the room collecting dust. Mr Singh's binder featured latest writing-replication technology called carbon paper. Even his rusty steel desk looked like a relic from the British Empire. After Mr Singh finished transcribing information from our documents into his binder, he joked that if things made sense at Moreh, the immigration office would be next to the custom office. But Moreh rolls a different way so we had to trek 2 km down the road to find the immigration office tucked behind a police station.

[immigration]

Earlier, Kunal remarked that Indian immigration officials were pretty strict and proper. But at Moreh, the immigration officer sat under a cow shed surrounded by meandering chickens. The back and forth between the officer and our team went over my head in Hindi. To me, it all felt pretty smooth. Later, Devanshi complained that the officer should have been wearing a proper uniform instead of yellow shorts and flip flops. In my book, the officer can be naked for all I care. I'd take a 3 hour border crossing any day.

[Moreh]

My first impression of India can be summarized in one word 'chaos'. Moreh has one main road shared by cars, rickshaws, trucks, bicycles, motorcycles and pedestrians. There was no curb so the notion of parking spots didn't really exist. People stopped their cars wherever they found a bit of space. As for the way people drive, I'd liken it to the way New York City cyclists ride  ignoring road rules completely, riding on sidewalks and against traffic. Imagine all the vehicles on the road behaving like that and there you have Indian traffic.

Over lunch, we discussed whether to drive on or stay the night in Moreh. Having just completed a smooth, border crossing, everyone felt pretty upbeat and optimistic. The next major city, Imphal, was only 110 KM away and the time was only 3:00pm. If the drive got too tough, we figured we could stop at a town along the road like Tengnoupal or Pallel. We voted to drive on.

Our gamble turned out to be a bad one. First, India's roads turned out to be worse than Myanmar's so we progressed very slowly. Second, we overlooked the fact that we lost an hour of daylight crossing the border. Finally, the two towns between Imphal and Moreh were little more than a collection of tin roof shacks and wood thatched huts. There any places for us to stay. We ended up enduring yet another hair raising, 4 hour drive in the pitch dark through the mountains.

We arrived safely in Imphal at around 8:00PM. Our car got a bit banged up, but for Team UK's campervan, the roads did some serious damage. Team Kontiki's brakes were shot, suspension rod were broken, and one of their spare tires fell off.

We have been traveling with Team Kontiki since Sept 26th. Together we shared some fantastic experiences through Kazakhstan, China and Myanmar. Imphal would be where we part ways.

===========

The people looked extremely diverse with a wide range of skin complextion and ethnic look.

We were all feeling excited about entering india. So naturally when the question to drive on or depart the following day, we opted to move forward. The next large town was Imphal,  We left Moreh at around 3:00pm, anticipating that we would arrive
We debated whether we would drive on or depart the following morning.

==========

The border between the India and Myanmar is marked by a river. The single lane steel bridge connecting the two countries was painted yellow on the Myanmar side and white on the India side.  The Myanmar border control looked pretty lax but Mr () often experienced problems. The last time Mr [] brought a team across Myanmar, the official at the border refused to stamp them out. It took Mr [] several phone calls and hours of negotation to stamp the team out. According to our guide, the Muse - Moreh was actually not an "official" border. I did some reasearch and discovered that Myanmar has been fighting a civil war for the last 68 years and the Myanmar central government doesn't really assert border control.  While we waited, I watched the local border officer scold and chastise our escort official.  But in the end, the process only took 30 minutes.





Devanshi assured me that the rest of India was not like this: Cars are randomly stopped at the roadside, crazy conjection.  Everywhere we went people directed us to the next spot. Moreh is a small town with a main road that cutting through the town. The structures  built along road the are mostly make shift structures with tin roofs. Cars are stopped at any place there is space. Tuktuk weave in and out of traffic.

[Lunch]

We stopped at what looked to be the nicest spot in town, Hotel Flora.

Over lunch we discussed the fact that the next town was about 200km away. If the roads were like china's then we could potentially reach there in 2 hours. If they were like Myanmar's roads, the drive would take around 5 hours. We figured  that we could brave the roads.

[Drive]

 More
Both our Team US and Team UK were pretty stoked about entering India. Moreh was busy, crowded and chaotic to me. To Kunal Devanshi and Team UK it all felt very familiar. Over lunch, we debated the question of whether we should drive on to the next city, or rest up and start the following morning. We opeted to drive on. hinkink that if necessary, we could always stop.







As we began, the roads were winding and mor so smooth. But as the drive wore one the conditions worsened. We had expcted to reach the next city at 6. But our progress slowed even more once the sun went down. This was not good for Team UK. At this point, their car had developed brake problems. Additionally, their suspensions was shot, and they lost their tire.


The road between Moreh and Imphal was challenging.


At this point, the big question in our minds was how Indian roads compared to Myanmar roads. With smooth roads, covering 100km in a day would be simple. Poor roads will result in our driving slowly.
