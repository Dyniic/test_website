So I promised I would have many more stories to tell. Here you go. Apparently USPS "missent" my UK visa application, containing my passport and other important documents to the wrong post office. The website has status 'missent'. I went to the USPS office underneath my office, only to find them close for Columbus Day. With time running out for my visas, this is going to be close. Stay tuned for updates.
