MMMT is in full fledged visa application mode. All of us were able to obtain a visa for Turkmenistan and we are now working on getting our visas for Kazakhstan. Stephen is flying to Berlin as I write to scout out the Magical Mongolian Mystery Mobile. We need to register it with The Adventurists by May 31 otherwise we are walking to Mongolia, so right now our fate rests with Stephen’s success…

In other exciting news, Tom and I just finished our 2L year at American University Washington College of Law! Well, sort of. Tom is taking a bunch of classes over the summer so that he can finish all his U.S. law school requirements before starting law school in Paris. I was supposed to write a paper for one of my classes to fulfill my writing requirement for graduation, but Mongol Rally got in the way. I got an extension so that I can “complete” it over the summer. How much have I written? 0 out of 40 pages. Woops! But I am sure I can write a 40 page paper, work full-time, and get everything together for 6 months abroad in the next 10 weeks!
