Every year, the New England Fencing Association hosts a fencing competition
called the &#8220;Pomme de Terre&#8221;. On June 19, Team Magical Mongolian
Mystery Tour sent a team to compete in the Men&#8217;s Foil Team event. The
team consisted:

* Stephen Jan the adventure ninja himself
* Dorian Cohen representing team sponsor &#8220;Jaguar Conservation Fund&#8221;
* Rolando Balboa representing team sponsor &#8220;Brooklyn Fencing Academy&#8221;
* Eddie Gregoriev representing the people of Kazakhstan

After driving 12 hours crossing 10 state borders running errands on behalf of
project Mongol Rally &#8216;10 that starting at 2AM Friday and included 3
midnight rest stop naps, and a fender bender with a Mercedes, Team MMT arrived
in Waltham, Massachusetts at 2AM Saturday morning for a 8AM competition. Sleep
deprived and warding off the New England heat and humidity, Team MMT managed to
prevail to win the day taking home the first place plaque!

Despite Team Magical Mongolian Mystery Tour&#8217;s mission to take medals away way from the locals, we found new friends and supporters:
