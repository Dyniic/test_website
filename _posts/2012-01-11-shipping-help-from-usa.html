<p>We&rsquo;ve been here 12 days now, nearly 2 weeks. Losing Kunal really sucked but we are now even more determined to reach Bamako. The longer it takes to get back on the road, the more complex the job becomes. Our Mauritania Visa is due to expire on the 23rd so if this drags on further than that we&rsquo;d have to go back up to Rabat to get another visa.</p>
<p>I began phoning Steve the moment we discovered that we weren&rsquo;t getting the parts from Casablanca.&#160; Phone cards cost 20 Dh, $2.50 and last 6 minutes. So usually I&rsquo;d call him go to the car, take pictures, call him, go back to the car, take more pictures call him. This back and forth went on for a couple days. But as of yesterday, the UPS shipment was placed. Back to the waiting game.</p>
