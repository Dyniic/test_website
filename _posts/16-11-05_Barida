================================================================================
Months ago, Devnashi proposed raising money for a non-profit school in Gujrat, India.
She came across the organization from a family friend.
At the time, I didn't have much context as to the challenges facing India, so raising money for that cause was as good a choice as any.
None of us on the team had ever met the founders XXX or YYY, nor have we ever seen the school.
So after 10,000 miles of driving, the entire team was eager to learn more about them.

[About Arrival]
On November 6, 2016, we drove 200km from Baroda to a spot somewhere between Valsad and Dharampur.
The school was a couple turns off the main road, tucked away behind trees and farmland.
Once the guard opened the metal gate guarding small road into a compound of 4 or 5 buildings, a woman dressed in traditional Gujrat-Indian clothing greeted us and helped us settle into the guest room.
I asked Kunal and Devnashi to share their about the charity.
I was surprised to hear that they really didn't have many thoughts at all, and that they weren't sure what to expect.
For me, I was really wondering if I would be impressed or disappointed by the work they did.

[About Founders and meeting]
The following morning, we met the Kedi School founder XXX.
XXX looked to be in her late forties and wore a plain rose sari.
She carried herself calmly and casually in a motherly way.
Sitting in a semicircle, we listened to the backstory behind the school.
Many years ago when she and YYY married, they both agreed to one day return to India.
While they built their careers in LA, they both spent any free time volunteering in rural Indian Schools teaching math, science, and art.
When they finally moved back India in 1989, they took it upon themselves to really investigate challenges facing rural communities.
They discovered that while the government provided primary school education to the district, there were no high schools.
The only option for rural families was to send a child to a neighboring semi-urban areas.
Also they discovered that the few families that could send their children to schools often only send the boys.
XXX and YYY formed Kedi School Residential School for Tribal Girls in 1989.

[About Kedi School]
Kedi school prioritizes helping girls in the most need.
The three criteria for acceptance are: test scores, distance, and income.
Kedi School grants seats to lowest scoring students that live furthest away with the lowest family income.
XXX described a teaching model that can best described as 'progressive', emphasizing self guided study over text book facts.
In fact, Kedi requires that teachers to teach without text books.
XXX explained that she wants teachers to guide student's natural curiosity, rather than fill them with facts.
This is certainly a departure from the type of learning I grew up with.

[]
We took a tour of their facility which included living space for 60 students, classrooms, and a science/computer room.
The computers were expectedly outdated. I don't see many CRT's these days.
They also had a sewing room, a small art room, and a shed where they keep a couple dairy cows.
Before we left, we did a short presentation to the kids explaining our journey - by 'we' i mean Kunal and Devnashi.
The presentation was followed by a game session led by Devnashi's brother where they played indian versions of duck-duck-goose and simon says.

At the end of the day, they are a well meaning genuine couple that wanted to do good.
They identified the problem and wanted to be part of the solution.
They did not want to sit on a board and manage policy, solve.
The name Kedi School translates to the Path, and she asserts that the objective of the school is to lay down a path for future generations.
Her appproach didn't seem very data driven, and to me felt whimsical.
What does generational change like?
My thought is that the school glosses over the fact that when it comes to testing, the students might not measure up to students with a stronger background.

[closing thoughts]
XXX and YYY are the are genuine embodiment of Gandhi's words "Be the change that you wish to see in the world".
They dropped comfortable lives in America to focus on difficult, meaningful work helping a neglected community.
I was skeptical that progressive teaching approach is the best way to help student behind in their studies catch up with their urban peers.
I'm also hesitant to accept that milking cows and operating sewing machines is the type of vocational training that lines up with jobs of the future.
But my opinion comes from a Western analytical approach.
At the end of our visit, XXX translated "Kedi" to mean "Path".
I had incorrectly interpreted "Path" to be "Path to success".

The story that XXX recounted wasn't the story of the alumni student going off to college.
It was the one who came back and told their family that they would only agree to marry an educated man.


Kedi school's vision is to pave the path for future generations.
But XXX puts the issue in better context when recounts the stories of alumni.
Kedi School graduates return to their villages.
Their life trajeectory often follows the traditional path: marraige.


Periodically, alumni

But Kedi's school is perhaps not to explcity bring more people out of poverty.
When XXX brings up anecdotes of alumni.
They aren't returning as university professors.
They are returning, as factory manager, and wives who have insisted that their partners be educated.


recounts visits be alumni returning to the school

 XXX explained "Kedi" means 'path'. The vision of Kedi School is to pave the path for future generations.

'Kedi' means the Path, and XXX explained that the school's aim is to pave the path for the next generation.
If these girls go home with the excpectation that trheir partners are educated, that increases the likelihood that the child they raise would value education - which would not have been the case before.

Kedi school has a much more modest objective, and it's to help create the conditions for families to value education. the following generation to value education.
I had to accept that it was okay for these kids not be on track to college, let alone IIT.
I am content to know that for the few in a position to consider college, our team has raised some funding to help out.

===========================================



Coming from America, I my initial reaction to what I saw was skepticism.
Considering that each student comes come the most challenging background, I was skeptical that a curriculoium not rooted in time and hard work would be the only way to "catch up" to peers with much better resources.
I questioned whether ANimal Huisbandry, Sewing, and block printing were the best skills to offer these kids.
Those skills are rooted in stereotypical female skills, why weren't they being tought to be plumbers, mechanics, and engineers?
I couldn't get a clear sense of the vision for the school.
But stepping back, I recounted XXX's explainatuib that Kedi means "Path".
This school is suppose to pave the path for the next generation.
She says that graduates do not all go off to collage.
The liklehood could be mback to start families, or factoriews.
The Path forward is to instill a sense of value that Education matters.
And the hope is that these girls will value Education in their partners, and for their children.
Imagine an american charity looking to the next generation to be the be the change they want to see.

There is more to animal husbandry than cleaning cow sheds and milking cows.
Vocational skills like sewing and knitting are still classified as low skill labor.
I wo hardly seems like the way to protect a family.

Kedi School

[layout how we discovered Kedi School]

Kunal saw it as a personal journey
Devanshi proposed the charity
I didn't really care.
At the time. hey were insistent on it being an indian charity.
NytoMumbai was originally envisioned to be a personal drive from NY to India.
After Africa, Kunal was keen on seeing if he could execute a similar project.
When Kunal initially proposed the road trip project to from New York To India, he framed it as a personal project.
After some research, Devanshi proposed that we support Kedi School.
This time around, Since I was taking a back seat, I was totally up


================================================================================
Months ago, the team proposed raising money for a school in rural Gujrat, India.
Kunal explained that poor families living in rural areas did not have access to adequate schooling.
Girls growing up in remote areas suffer the most as their education often takes a back seat to other family priorities.
Responding to this need, XXX and YYY formed Kedi School for tribal girls.
None of us had ever met XXX or YYY, nor have we ever seen the school.
I was eager to really understand what exactly Kedi School does.

[About Arrival]
On November 6, 2016, we drove 200km from Baroda to an out-of-the-way area between Valsad and Dharampur.
The school was a couple turns off the main road, and tucked away behind trees and farmland.
A low metal gate protected the road into a complex of concrete, two story, yellow buildings.
A woman dressed in traditional Indian clothing led our car to a parking area and then to our guest room.
That night, we discussed our initial impressions of the school.
Visiting a charity for the first time, Kunal and Devnashi admitted that they weren't sure what to expect.
For me, I was very curious to see if the challenge here was similar to the challenged in America to provide education to poor families in America.

[About Founders and meeting]
We met the founder the following morning.
Sitting in a semicircle around XXX, we listened to the story of Kedi School.
YYY was an investment Banker and XXX was an architect for many years in America.
When they married, they agreed to one day return to India to do charitable work in rural India.
As they bulit their careers in LA, XXX and YYY spent their free time volunteering at Rural Indian schools teaching Math, Science, and Art.
In 1989, they finally pulled the trigger and moved back India.
At the time, they had no concrete plans.
They took it upon themselves to really investigate and understand first hand the challenges that rural communities faced.
They discovered that while about 1000 primary schools served the rural Valsad, there was not a single high school.
A family would send their child to a neighboring semi-urban areas for a high school education.
Furthermore, families tended to send the boys and keep the daughters at home to help around the house until marrying age.
Reacting to this, XXX opened a school for tribal girls.
Today they are ranked among the best schools in the region.

[About Kedi School]
Kedi school prioritizes fulfilling need over performance.
The three criteria for acceptance are: test scores, distance, and income.
Rather than selecting high scoring students, Kedi School grants seats to low scoring students.
Rather than selecting students close by, Kedi school grants seats to students far away.
Rather than selecting students with the most resources to pay tution, they select students from poorest families.
XXX described a fairly progressive, open teaching style for Kedi school.
Teachers were required to teach without text books.
They should a guide student's natural rather than emphasizing reguritating information.
As someone who went through the rote style of learning, this all sounded pretty fantastic.

[]
Our tour of their facility receivel that in additional to the basic subjects like Math, English, Hindi and Science, Kedi school They provided vocational training such as Animal Hubandry, Sweing, and Block printing.
Before we left, we did a short presentation to the kids explaining our journey - by 'we' i mean Kunal and Devnashi.
The presentation was followed by a game session led by Devnashi's brother where they played indian versions of duck-duck-goose and simon says.
We also got a tour of the facilitiy.
Behind the school is a cow shed where they teach animal husbandry.


Devnashi: what was impression of the tour?
Me: The girls looked pretty quiet. It seems to me they're just standing around.
Devnashi: yeah what's wrong with that?
Me: Well aren't they supposed to be doing homework?
Devcanshi: Well they just got back from Diwali break!
Me: But if they're so behind, they should be rushing to catch up!

At the end of the day, they are a well meaning genuine couple that wanted to do good.
They identified the problem and wanted to be part of the solution.
They did not want to sit on a board and manage policy, solve.
The name Kedi School translates to the Path, and she asserts that the objective of the school is to lay down a path for future generations.
Her appproach didn't seem very data driven, and to me felt whimsical.
What does generational change like?
My thought is that the school glosses over the fact that when it comes to testing, the students might not measure up to students with a stronger background.

[closing thoughts]
Kedi School is run by two genuine individuals who have dedicated their lives to helping others.
The founders look to successful models from all around the world, and draw upon ideas and expose these children to this stuff.
Coming from America, I my initial reaction to what I saw was skepticism.
Considering that each student comes come the most challenging background, I was skeptical that a curriculoium not rooted in time and hard work would be the only way to "catch up" to peers with much better resources.

What I saw was a range of contradictions.


What i wondered was whether this was the best way to deliver education.
they painted an idyllic picture almost too good to beleive.
When I asked her about the main challeges that the school face, she said that there wern't any.
They weren't really all that interested in publicity or raising more money.



On one hand, Kedi school doesn't seem to really bring a girl out of tribal society into "modern" society.
On the other hand, if the aim is to create the conditions such that the next generation appretiates, education, perhaps that's the best possible outcome we can hope for.
And that the urgency that our american charities to forcefulll bring change

To me, aquiring vocational skills requires training and practice. Even sometime like Animal Husbandry is more than milking cows and cleaning sheds.
Breeding .
Hearing a comment like "it's better to milk cows by and and it's more humane" seems to me one of those comments  that comes from a a sense of the old way is always better.


[Tour]
For a class of 80, I felt like the school was fairly large. On the roof, they had what looked like solar panels


We took a breif tour of the school. They have a computer room with old CRT monitors.
There is a room outfitted with sewing machines.
XXX explains that they emphasis giving their students practale skills that can elp grils land job after ghradution.

Kunal presented our journey to the girls and quizzed a bit on geography.

[Leaving]
XXX arrange some time for us to present our journey.
Kunal explained where Kunal presented described some.
The students were well aware of most the countries on the map, USA, England, Russia, China.
We passed around some of the artifacts of our journey like ucrrencies, and math.

Most these girls have never leave the province, let along the country.
We impressed upon them the idea thatr the world was big and worth seeing.


The idea that land borders could be crossed by cars.



Our stay was pretty short.
But XXX we suggested doing a presentation about our joirney.

-long term vision?
-challenges fort the organization? no answer
Good things.
-long term view train the next generation
-doesn't want to answer to anyone

I fail
I came away from this experience with several thoughts.
First, Tribal doesn't mean tribal.
The Founders have this pie in the sky notion.
They are dogooders.
But at the end of the day, I think they work is valuable and important.




==================================================================================


Devanshi had selected this school by reaching out to her social network to receive a recommendation, so the trurh was that no one on the team had any contact with the organization.
Prior to entering india, I didn't really have a good sense as to how lacking Indian infrastructure really was.
I discovered deep divisions within their culture.
Over the course of the journey, I did discover a couple subtle things. The main being about Castes in india.
I would suggest that the notion of caste is very
Over the course of the journey that Tribal Girls meant something very specific and not a general adjective to describe a person.
A "Tribal" is a specific set of set of subclass of people that are assumed to be undereducated and poor.
Over the course of the journey, I discovered the vast disparity between what would be considered a normal "socialized" member of society and village people.
I also discovered that the concept of "Tribal" is actually very specific. In fact, it is an official designation, That along with the idea of backward.
Travelling through India, I discovered that in india "tribal" was not a normal adjective.
In fact, it is an official social construct.
I'm not exactly sure what it's meant in this context, but I realized that this toye of categorization is completely out of my spectyrum, I should not expect to understand the subtleties of what a Tribal Giurl was, of what a "Backward Class" was. However as we approached the school, I couldn't help but to wonder to my self:

I didn't understand  I debated at length about

After arriving in india, I started noticing several things.





Throughout the journey, no matter how many times Kunal and Devnashi described Kedi School, I still didn't really understand what set them apart from any other Indian charity.
I'll be perfectly honest and chalk it up to ignorance: I have no idea what Valsad is like. I have no idea what tribal girls were. I have no idea what the current state. I had many quetsionbs in my head:

After travelling through the country, I discovered that there are a couple concepts that I really didn't grasp.
First, India's caste system runs deep.
It's not engrained into my mind.
But a "Tribal" girl means something very specific. Just as a "Backward" means something very specific.

-Why Kedi school?
-Why are Tribal girls?
-What are tribal girls?
-If Kedi School is a highschool, how do you account for the variable level of incoming students?
-Does Kedi school charge the students?
-What is the what does Kedi school envision for their students? Join the work force?
-It seems to me like




All that being said, I felt fortunate that I would have the opportunity to witness for myself what this school was about.

To be honest, I didn't have much of an opinion about it.
Kunal told me that this area is known to be poor.
and was known to be particularly poor and underprivleged.

At the time, I had no idea where Valsad was, nor did I really understand what tribal girls were.
I took it on face value that this school did good work, and that I was not in a position to judge.
One of the main motivations surrounding these projects is that each team member should at the end observe and ask questions about the charity and arrive at his own conclusions as to whether the work is important.

Questions that came up:
As we neared the Kedi school, I started wondering to myself:


I vaguely surmised that this school generally delivered education to an underserved community.

I must guiltily admit that this charity didn't leave me with much an impression.
I had no idea what Valsad was, what Tribal Girls.




When I probed for some more information on the matter, I was



 in India that focused on bringing education to tribal girls.
To me, selecting Kedi school was sorta like picking a charity out of a hat




Months ago, Devanshi approached the team and proposed that the project raise money for a charity called "Kedi School".

I asked him whether the journey would be a personal trip, or a charity rally and at the time he wexplain that it would be personal.
At the time, devanshi had pitch the idea that the a charitable angle would be attractive.
When I probed them about what sort of charity, she was a bit uncertain, but was conviniced it made sense to support an indian charity.
For the reasons A month or so later, Kunal and Devanshi proposed supporting Kedi School.
At the time, I wasn't exactly sure why, but since it was their project, I was okay with it.
At the time, the drive did not have a charity tilt, I think mostly because they did not wrap the idea around their head that it could.
It did take some time to settle on the idea that we could incorporate a cause into the journey.
Kunal And Devanshi settled on KEDI school.
At the time, I wasn't exactly sure what this chool did, I was also not clear as top and raise money for a charity.
Over the courpse or planning and the drive, Kunal and Devnashi described things that they did.
But i was never really sure what was going on with these jokers.
Desipte all the projects I do, I am honestly a skeptic. I had a long debate with Devnahsi's father about the idea An inherent disconnect as to why this school lifts these Tribal girls out of poverty
What about opportunity?



[Arrival]
We arrived as a team.

With us was: Kunal's Mom, Devanshi's family, and her fiend

On Nov XXX, we arrived in two cars. Kunal, his mom,  Devnashi, her family and a family friend.


 in the middle of the night. It took some time to find the school since by the time we neared the town, night as fallen and our driving speak falls to like 20 miles per hour.
When we arrive, we came upon a cluster of buildings pretected by a large gate. The place was quiet, and reminded me of sleep away camps.
That night, I asked around to get a sense as to what the team was expecting.
Kunal:
The following morning, I was surprised to discover that they

At the time, several  questions came to mind about INdian education in general.
I poksed this quetison to Devanshi's parents.

 To me there was this tenstion between What should indian education provide vs what. The notion of standards

We discussed what the liklihood of bringing students up to speed


[Meeting the kids and founder]

[closing thoughts]

The School is tucked away in the rural Dharampur.

The entire project was conceived largely for personal reasons: Indial and Devanshi were indian.

I wasn't too clear on the collaboration between our organization and their so I was eager to really understand what this finish line was going to look like.


Over
 were not sure exactly what the plan would be.
However, it was clear that they did want to incorperate a charitible mission into their project.
Over the following months, I would hear bits and peices about what Kedi school was and . From what I gathered, they were not very well orgainzed.
it took significant time to even get pictures and stuff to get a better udnerstanding as to what they were doing. I caught several glimpses of the girls.
I asked how come they weren't doing homework.
As much as I was kinda joking, I also felt like student were behind, I would tihnk that the only way to catch up was through rigours hard work.
HGow can you remain comptitive if you don't have an inkling of competition?
Can you really catch up by coasting?
maybe i didn't get to see everythibng

They had sewing, knitting rooms. The following morning, I was invited to watch the milk man work the animals. What i observed was the milk person milk the cows while the girls watched.


The following morning, I came down to see

Curcy roads and the night fall made finding the school was challening.

Kedi School was founded in 2001 by XXX and YYY. They built their careers in California a Investment nbanking and archtectre. Kunal explained to me that this group was identified by a family friend. At the beginning of the joun

We walked around and.
Over diner, we debated whether this generation should learn computer skills or just jump to tablets.
The kids are under nourished because they don't like eating the food they provide.

Earlier in the day, Devanshi's brother Chinmaya invited me over to check out the morning cow milking session.
One aspect that Kedi school not only offers a High school, it also teaches vocational skills such as animal husbandry.
I've never seen a cow milking so I tagged along.
I stood for about 15 minutes watching some dude milking the cow into a pail.
The girl was hist assitant for the day.
Chinmaya leanred over and mentioned that they do it by hand because it's better for the cow.
After the milking was complete, Chinmaya asked if I would haveliked a glass of fresh milk.
as i thought in my mind several things flashed in my head.
I politely declined.
