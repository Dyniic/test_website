============================
Kedi School

[layout how we discovered Kedi School]

Kunal saw it as a personal journey
Devanshi proposed the charity
I didn't really care.
At the time. hey were insistent on it being an indian charity.
NytoMumbai was originally envisioned to be a personal drive from NY to India.
After Africa, Kunal was keen on seeing if he could execute a similar project.
When Kunal initially proposed the road trip project to from New York To India, he framed it as a personal project.
After some research, Devanshi proposed that we support Kedi School.
This time around, Since I was taking a back seat, I was totally up


================================================================================
Months ago, the team proposed raising money for a school in rural Gujrat, India.
Kunal explained that families living in the poor communities in Valsad did not have access to adequte schooling.
Girls growing up in this area suffer the most their education often takes back seat to other family priorities.
Responding to this need, XXX and YYY formed Kedi School for tribal Girls.
None of us had ever met XXX or YYY, nor have we ever seen the school.
All I really knew was that Devanshi found the charity through a family friend so I was eager to see the school and meet the founders.

//Furthermore, I realized only after entering India that my interpretation of a "Tribal" girl was completely off base.

[Arrival]
On November 6, 2016, we drove 200km from Baroda to Valsad and arrived in the early evening.
Normally, a 200km drive would be pretty short so long as the roads were decent, but we spent half the day in Navsari meeting up with Dayal of Team Kontiki.
The school itself was tucked away, a couple turns off the main road between Valsad and Dharampur.
A low wall and gate protected a cluster of two story buildings, Kedi school being the largest and furthest down the road.
A woman led the team to the room in the building up the hill from Kedi that we would all stay.
The woman invited us over to the School for dinner and got our first glimpse of the school.
We ate dinner at the school and After a traditional Gujrat dinner, we took a breif tour of the building.
We caught a glimpse of classrooms and living quaters.
We drove past a gate and several small houses to a cluster of buildings.
It didn't seem like it at the time but the school shared their space with a clinic.
There were a cluster of buildings, and they told me that they shared the school like a hospital.

[The following day]
The following morning, Devanshi's brother invited me over to the Kedi School cow shed to check out the morning cow milking session.
I've never seen a cow milking so I tagged along.
Kedi school not only bills itself as a High school, it also teaches vocational skills and Animal Husbandry.
Standing there, I watched some dude milking the cow into the.
They asserted that doingh it by hand is more humane for the cows than using a machine.
as what I guess was a consultant milk the cow.
Assisting him was a young girl.
I couldn't tell if

The following morning after pretzles and potato chips breakfast, Chinmaya invited me over to check out how they milk cows.
I walked over to the school.
The school keeps like 4 cows.
Behind the school, they kept about 4 cows.

As I stood there, I watched a man milk while the girl watched.
I wondered to myself whether this was an important skill to hacve

Part of the Kedi school curriculum is to teach vocational skills. Such skills included animal husbandry, Sewing, Block printing, knitting.

[Cow Milking]
They offered me a cup of milk.
At the time i was already sick so no thanks.
My general thought is that I didn't need to get any sicker.


[meting]
At around 1000 the founder arrived. She was a proper looking woman probably in her late forties.
We all sat ardound in a circle while she explain to us the story of Kedi school

[closing thoughts]



we walked over for bfest
then we met up with the founder
then we did a presntation
then the other founder came







Devanshi had selected this school by reaching out to her social network to receive a recommendation, so the trurh was that no one on the team had any contact with the organization.
Prior to entering india, I didn't really have a good sense as to how lacking Indian infrastructure really was.
I discovered deep divisions within their culture.
Over the course of the journey, I did discover a couple subtle things. The main being about Castes in india.
I would suggest that the notion of caste is very
Over the course of the journey that Tribal Girls meant something very specific and not a general adjective to describe a person.
A "Tribal" is a specific set of set of subclass of people that are assumed to be undereducated and poor.
Over the course of the journey, I discovered the vast disparity between what would be considered a normal "socialized" member of society and village people.
I also discovered that the concept of "Tribal" is actually very specific. In fact, it is an official designation, That along with the idea of backward.
Travelling through India, I discovered that in india "tribal" was not a normal adjective.
In fact, it is an official social construct.
I'm not exactly sure what it's meant in this context, but I realized that this toye of categorization is completely out of my spectyrum, I should not expect to understand the subtleties of what a Tribal Giurl was, of what a "Backward Class" was. However as we approached the school, I couldn't help but to wonder to my self:

I didn't understand  I debated at length about

After arriving in india, I started noticing several things.





Throughout the journey, no matter how many times Kunal and Devnashi described Kedi School, I still didn't really understand what set them apart from any other Indian charity.
I'll be perfectly honest and chalk it up to ignorance: I have no idea what Valsad is like. I have no idea what tribal girls were. I have no idea what the current state. I had many quetsionbs in my head:

After travelling through the country, I discovered that there are a couple concepts that I really didn't grasp.
First, India's caste system runs deep.
It's not engrained into my mind.
But a "Tribal" girl means something very specific. Just as a "Backward" means something very specific.

-Why Kedi school?
-Why are Tribal girls?
-What are tribal girls?
-If Kedi School is a highschool, how do you account for the variable level of incoming students?
-Does Kedi school charge the students?
-What is the what does Kedi school envision for their students? Join the work force?
-It seems to me like




All that being said, I felt fortunate that I would have the opportunity to witness for myself what this school was about.

To be honest, I didn't have much of an opinion about it.
Kunal told me that this area is known to be poor.
and was known to be particularly poor and underprivleged.

At the time, I had no idea where Valsad was, nor did I really understand what tribal girls were.
I took it on face value that this school did good work, and that I was not in a position to judge.
One of the main motivations surrounding these projects is that each team member should at the end observe and ask questions about the charity and arrive at his own conclusions as to whether the work is important.

Questions that came up:
As we neared the Kedi school, I started wondering to myself:


I vaguely surmised that this school generally delivered education to an underserved community.

I must guiltily admit that this charity didn't leave me with much an impression.
I had no idea what Valsad was, what Tribal Girls.




When I probed for some more information on the matter, I was



 in India that focused on bringing education to tribal girls.
To me, selecting Kedi school was sorta like picking a charity out of a hat




Months ago, Devanshi approached the team and proposed that the project raise money for a charity called "Kedi School".

I asked him whether the journey would be a personal trip, or a charity rally and at the time he wexplain that it would be personal.
At the time, devanshi had pitch the idea that the a charitable angle would be attractive.
When I probed them about what sort of charity, she was a bit uncertain, but was conviniced it made sense to support an indian charity.
For the reasons A month or so later, Kunal and Devanshi proposed supporting Kedi School.
At the time, I wasn't exactly sure why, but since it was their project, I was okay with it.
At the time, the drive did not have a charity tilt, I think mostly because they did not wrap the idea around their head that it could.
It did take some time to settle on the idea that we could incorporate a cause into the journey.
Kunal And Devanshi settled on KEDI school.
At the time, I wasn't exactly sure what this chool did, I was also not clear as top and raise money for a charity.
Over the courpse or planning and the drive, Kunal and Devnashi described things that they did.
But i was never really sure what was going on with these jokers.
Desipte all the projects I do, I am honestly a skeptic. I had a long debate with Devnahsi's father about the idea An inherent disconnect as to why this school lifts these Tribal girls out of poverty
What about opportunity?



[Arrival]
We arrived as a team.

With us was: Kunal's Mom, Devanshi's family, and her fiend

On Nov XXX, we arrived in two cars. Kunal, his mom,  Devnashi, her family and a family friend.


 in the middle of the night. It took some time to find the school since by the time we neared the town, night as fallen and our driving speak falls to like 20 miles per hour.
When we arrive, we came upon a cluster of buildings pretected by a large gate. The place was quiet, and reminded me of sleep away camps.
That night, I asked around to get a sense as to what the team was expecting.
Kunal:
The following morning, I was surprised to discover that they

At the time, several  questions came to mind about INdian education in general.
I poksed this quetison to Devanshi's parents.

 To me there was this tenstion between What should indian education provide vs what. The notion of standards

We discussed what the liklihood of bringing students up to speed


[Meeting the kids and founder]

[closing thoughts]

The School is tucked away in the rural Dharampur.

The entire project was conceived largely for personal reasons: Indial and Devanshi were indian.


I wasn't too clear on the collaboration between our organization and their so I was eager to really understand what this finish line was going to look like.


Over
 were not sure exactly what the plan would be.
However, it was clear that they did want to incorperate a charitible mission into their project.
Over the following months, I would hear bits and peices about what Kedi school was and . From what I gathered, they were not very well orgainzed.
it took significant time to even get pictures and stuff to get a better udnerstanding as to what they were doing. I caught several glimpses of the girls.
I asked how come they weren't doing homework.
As much as I was kinda joking, I also felt like student were behind, I would tihnk that the only way to catch up was through rigours hard work.
HGow can you remain comptitive if you don't have an inkling of competition?
Can you really catch up by coasting?
maybe i didn't get to see everythibng

They had sewing, knitting rooms. The following morning, I was invited to watch the milk man work the animals. What i observed was the milk person milk the cows while the girls watched.


The following morning, I came down to see

Curcy roads and the night fall made finding the school was challening.

Kedi School was founded in 2001 by XXX and YYY. They built their careers in California a Investment nbanking and archtectre. Kunal explained to me that this group was identified by a family friend. At the beginning of the joun
