Reunited we took off from our shared hotel and our friends and began the drive
back up the Greece coast. The truckers were back on the roads and stores were
once again stocked. After hours of driving, we stopped for dinner in a small
coastal town with a sign that said &#8220;award-winning beach.&#8221; The town
was called asprovolta. It looked like it could have been cape hatteras or cape
cod just without the mini-golf courses. There were beachside cafes with
umbrellas, sand volleyball courts, and lawnchairs. Team mmt sat down at a
friendly looking spot and ordered some octopus, salad, and scampi. The sun
started setting over the mountains and the octopus tasted like a tender steak.
The water was cool and refreshing. We were tired, dirty, and sweaty but it was
good to take a brief break from the road and enjoy the Greek coast. As we left
town we flashed our blue ambulance lights and waved to the on-lookers.
