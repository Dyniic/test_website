Kazakhstan is a huge country. Years ago, as part of the mongol rally, I drove from the west coast to Omsk. On that trip I came to understand what bad road and infrastructure looked like. But Kazakhstan's huge, and Astana actually has decent infrastrucrue, with smooth roads. Despite the smooth roads Kunal was driving below the speed limit.




The drive from Astana to Zarkent was short and largely uneventful.
Fruit stands dot the highway so we stopped at one.
Somewhere
Kunal was driving really really slowly.


To most people around the world, Kazakhstan is a bit of a mystery.
To some it's a stan, which means that it's an islamic country.
Islam being associated with violence, we think it's like Pakistan.
To others, it's an ex-soviet union country in the Russian sphere.
And is regarded with deep suspicion.

The two main things that i walk away from Kazkhstan with is that it's a huge country, wedged between China and Russia. I was a bit more curious as to how a Kazakh sees the world.
