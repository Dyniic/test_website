split up from kontiki
imphale is dusty and busy
rickshaws everywhere
asian looking faces
it's hot hot hot
people are chiny
food takes forever
no hot water
drove into the night
it took its toll on tontiki's car

Angami people
Cowshed amid chickens
Car is beating me up
hotel was nice
in the middle of nowhere
roads are really crappy
people are super nice, ending each sentence with "sir"
