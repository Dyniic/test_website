It&#8217;s time for another injury report. Judy came down with something, a
bug of some sort over night, and woke up this morning feeling dizzy,  weak,
and exhausted. She ate healthily throughout the day, drank lots of  fluids,
and relaxed. Citrus fruits became a large part of her diet. She  is working
vigorously (while relaxing) to nurse herself back to good  health, looked
stronger tonight, and should be golden tomorrow or the  next day.

Stephen is in New York, and the author of this post is unaware of his  health
status, although he appears to be in good health. Stephen will  travel to
Washington, D.C. this weekend for a fencing tournament, which  Judy and Tom
plan to attend for team support and bonding. This weekend,  the trio will most
likely discuss more details, post more blogs, get  healthy together over some
beers or vicodin in Tom&#8217;s case, and plant a  garden at the Porter House
(1924).

Tom will soon post before surgery, or BS, pictures of his nose and face.  Tom
cannot breath out of either nostrel and has a very crooked, broken,  and
battered nose. Not for beauty but for health, Tom will go under the  knife
later this morning, undergoing a full rhinoplasty, two-hour long  cosmetic
surgery to fix his nose&#8230; to right the ship so to speak which  is now
protruding oddly from his face. Tom has an appointment for  digital imaging at
7:30 am eastern standard time, when the doctor and  surgeon will computerize
how the nose will be shaped. T&#8217; Twittle then  has a noon out-patient,
anesthetized surgery which should last  approximately two hours if all goes
well. Post-operation (PO) pictures -  splint, blood, gauze, and all to follow
as well. TommyD will be  recovering at the Porter House with vicodin and
anti-biotics while  watching episodes of Man v. Wild, 24, House, and the new
show on HBO  about post-Katrina New Orleans.

It's crunch time near finals time here in D.C., so it's time to get
back  to some work.

So, there you have it&#8230; our team is a little dinged up right now, but
that&#8217;s certainly not going to stop us. WE may slow down a bit here these
next few days, but much work and excitement to come. peace y&#8217;all.
