Stephen is&nbsp;keeping busy&nbsp;learning the inner-workings of car engines
and will hopefully keep us out of trouble when it comes to fixing up the
ambulance. Judy is honing her horse-riding skills, mastering  bike-riding and
car-driving (both stick shift and automatic), and  bench-pressing several times
per week. tom is drastically improving his  violin dexterity in addition to
hitting the gym hard in an effort to  improve his vertical leap.

team injury reports will be provided weekly perhaps monthly until  mongol rally
 &#8216;10 depending on the severity and frequency of injuries:
Judy and Stephen appear to be in good health. tom recently broke his  nose and
deviated his septum. he can no longer breath out of either  nostril and will
have surgery to straighten that baby out in a week and a  half. before and
after pictures to come&#8230; the nose must be straight  for mongol rally.

or&#8230;.

tom may decide to leave the nose the way it is and attempt to take on  Owen Wilson-type movie roles. tom also has a cool face mask he wears to  play basketball. it glows in the dark.
