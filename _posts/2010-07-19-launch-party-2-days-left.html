Thanks everyone for coming to the Launch Party! I feel absolutely lucky to have so many people support us. I look forward to return with an experience of a lifetime and some great stories to tell! Now with the launch party behind
me, I have two days to finish my stateside preparations and head to Berlin. I'm still waiting for my Azerbaijan Visa. Hopefully DC team will pull through and get that to me by tomorrow morning.
