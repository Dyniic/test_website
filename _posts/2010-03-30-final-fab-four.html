Well, we've been pretty quiet on the blogging front but be assured that
 we are working tirelessly to make this happen. We're about 60% of  the
 way to our MercyCorps fund raising target!

In an earlier post, I mentioned that we narrowed our search down to
  &#8220;Used Ambulance&#8221;. Since then, I&#8217;ve been researching and
  interviewing  knowledgeable people about selecting this &#8220;Used
  Ambulance&#8221;. According to  my expert, uptown, source at Bronx
  Community, diesel is preferable over  petrol when driving through the
  scorching summer heat.That being the  case, we&#8217;ve narrowed down our
  vehicle choices to four candidates that  are within our budget. In the spirit
  of the Magical Mystery Tour, I&#8217;ve  dubbed each vehicle a Beatles
  nickname.

| Ambulance 1   | The Lennon |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Model         | VW T4 |
| Year          | 1995 |
| Current  Location| Berlin, Germany  |
