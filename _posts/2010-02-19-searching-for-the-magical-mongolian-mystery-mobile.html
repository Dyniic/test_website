Now that we've rolled out our website, we can really start moving along.
Pasquale is working on a logo and banner that will surely kick some ass. We
will be focusing our efforts to hit that $2000 charity mark and raising money
for a vehicle that will (hopefully) take us to Mongolia!

Since it's still early in the game for getting a vehicle, we plan to aim for
the &#8220;public service vehicle&#8221; route or vehicle of significant
&#8220;comedy value&#8221;. Here are some of the vehicles that we&#8217;ve been
considering:

# Fire Truck

# Ambulance
