Woke up earliy to go to Nissan Service Center Dealership
THey proposed to fix the shock absober
The team felt skeptical
we split up

First we tried getting a ola cab

Next we went to the hotel across the street
a customer offered to give us a ride
Veg biriyani was good

We thanks ed him and he offered to give us a ride into the city to see the ganges
