Colin use to run a trucking company. Back then, he employed Hassan as the primary mechanic. According to Colin, when it comes to fixing trucks Hassan's your man - trustworthy, loyal, and much more competent than any of those swindling Moroccan mechanics from Marrakesh. On New Year's Day 2012, a Sunday, at around&#160; 2:00pm Hassan got a phone call about a certain Ford 350 ambulance with a transmission problem. By 3:00pm Hassan showed up at Colin's place ready to examine the car. I can't imagine a mechanic in the USA opening his shop on Sunday, New Year's day like that. But Colin's one of those people with the type of mysterious backgrounds that can make these things happen.

We dropped off the ambulance at Hassan's and once again turned Colin's living room into our internet Caf&eacute;.
