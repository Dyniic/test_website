<p>We&#8217;ve made a couple key decisions over the weekend.<&#47;p></p>
<p>First, we&#8217;ve decided that we&#8217;re going to charge full steam ahead for  the ambulance. Looking at online German classifieds(mobile.de), it  appears that used ambulances are available for under 3000USD! Hopefully  they&#8217;re in working order&#8230;.<&#47;p></p>
<p>Second, we&#8217;ve started plotting our route. At this point in time, the  route will take us across 17 different countries!<&#47;p></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve added a section to the site dedicated to the Magical  Mongolian  Mystery Mobile and Touring route!<&#47;p></p>
