My friend Sasha whom I met on the Mongol Rally in Irkutsk, invited me to a gathering at a Buddhism Center in London. There we met people from all walks of life, from every corner of Europe, and every single one of them fascinated about our daring journey to Africa.

We headed back to the ambulance and spent our first night in the car as a team. Dennis braved the hammock insisting that it would suit him. Kunal took the bench. Mike and I slept on the air mattress setup out on the floor. On a 1-10 scale of comfort rating I rate this as 4. But throw in the ambulance adventure factor and you&rsquo;re snoozing at a comfortable 10.
