My passion for coaching runs deep.  So deep, that I will move mountains for you.  Together we will reach great heights, savour the view, and reflect on the path taken.  Growth and development paths are not always straight forward.  They ebb and flow. They meander and wind.  They lead us to thrilling heights, to peaceful plateaus, and over hills we didn't see coming.

I am an Integral Master Coach™, certified by Integral Coaching Canada. It is the only accredited Integral Coaching® program in the world that surpasses the Masters Level requirements of the International Coach Federation.  The coaching methodology I use works.  I don't say that lightly, nor because it's the method that I use.  I say it because it's true.  I have experienced the power of being coached myself and seen it work over and over again with my clients.

I teach beginners meditation at the Ottawa Shambhala Centre, and I have over 10 years experience working with executives and managers in the federal public service. I hold a degree in Family and Social Relations from the University of Guelph, a Master’s Degree in Public Administration from Queen’s University and a Sommelier Certificate from Algonquin College. I celebrate diversity and aim to work with clients from all walks of life including the LGBTQ and poly communities.

It would be my privilege to coach you on your journey, just tell me which mountain you want to ascend.  I will be there by your side rooting for you, and guiding you to develop new capacities and to see new ways to scale that seemingly impossible obstacle.
