Heather has always lived outside the mainstream.  From a young girl she found herself questioning the status quo and advocating for her church, her schools and her communities to be a more welcoming and inclusive place for everyone.  For example, Heather organized pride events in the late 1990s, has performed and/or organized the Vagina Monologues in Guelph, Kingston and Ottawa, and created an LGBTQ education program through the Wellness Centre at the University of Guelph.  She is currently a Positive Space Champion in the federal government.  Heather has a particular interest in working with clients who are struggling with being part of a marginalized population, including dealing with LGBTQ and poly relationship issues in their lives.

Drawing on her experience as a beginners’ meditation instructor, and her 10 years doing policy work in the federal government, Heather offers a balanced approach to development that is tailored to each individual client’s strengths and their needs in order to most effectively guide them to leading, living, loving and launching to their potential.
