Heather is a certified Integral Master Coach™ whose passion for working with coaching clients runs deep. Her focus is on helping each client develop, and reach his or her goals. She is constantly searching for and applying new approaches to ascend the challenges and roadblocks of modern life.  

Heather was drawn to become a coach after working on her own coaching program in 2011.  When Heather asks her clients to try something new and take a risk, she knows how that may feel, having gone through years of personal growth and development since embarking on her Masters certification process.  Guiding her clients to grow in meaningful ways is a constant drive for Heather.  Coaching not only allows her clients to grow into their potential, but also serves Heather’s desire to put her highest skills into practice in service of creating a more awake and intentional world.  

Drawing on her experience as a beginners’ meditation instructor, and over 10 years experience working with executives and managers in federal public service, Heather offers a balanced approach to development that is tailored to each individual client’s strengths and their needs in order to most effectively guide them to leading, living, loving and launching to their potential.

Heather celebrates diversity and aims to broaden horizons in how we define relationships.  She works with clients from all walks of life, including those working through with issues related to LGBTQ and poly relationship challenges.

Heather graduated at the Masters level in December 2016 from Integral Coaching Canada, which is the only accredited Integral Coaching® program in the world that surpasses Masters Level International Coach Federation requirements.  Heather holds a degree in Family and Social Relations from the University of Guelph, a Master’s Degree in Public Administration from Queen’s University and a sommelier certificate from Algonquin College.
