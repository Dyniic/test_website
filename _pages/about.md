The goal of EMCL is to facilitate dialogue among language researchers with different methodological backgrounds, i.e. theorists, experimentalists, corpus linguists, etc. We do this by creating an environment where specialists learn from each other by developing a research project together where their various skills are combined.

Intended audience: Language researchers with an embodiment, situated cognition and/or cognitive linguistics background. No prior experimental or corpus training is required though an understanding of the theoretical issues is necessary. Participants can be at different early stages in their careers, i.e. graduate students/post-grads, post-docs, junior faculty, etc.

Format: Participants will join one of seven hands-on mini-labs for the duration of the week-long workshop. Each mini-lab will be responsible for completing a joint research project. A select group of students (max. eight per group for a total of 56) will be invited to participate. Each group will work with two researchers who will guide them in selecting an idea to investigate. They will then participate in structuring and organizing a research project, and carrying it out. The session will end with a mini-conference where findings will be presented, followed by a general discussion.
